    cardTitle: "The “Pittsburgh Proclamation.”",
    cardSubtitle: "Adopted by the Founding Congress of the American Federation of the International Working People’s Association",
    cardDetailedText:"Comrades! In the Declaration of Independence of the United States we read: When a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Has the moment not arrived to heed the advice of Thomas Jefferson, the true founder of the American Republic? Has government not become oppression? And is our government anything but a conspiracy of the ruling classes against the people — against you? Comrades! Hear what he have to say. Read our manifesto, written in your interest and for the welfare of your wives and children and toward the good of humanity and progress. Our present society is founded upon the exploitation of the propertyless class by the propertied. This exploitation is such that the propertied (capitalists) but the working force body and soul of the propertyless, for the price of the mere cost of existence (wages) and take for themselves, i.e., steal the amount of new values (products) which exceeds the price, whereby wagesare made to represent the necessities instead of the earnings of the wage-laborer. As the non-possessing classes are forced by their poverty to offer for sale to the propertied their working forces, and as our present production on a grandscale enforces technical development with immense rapidity, so that by the application of an always decreasing number of human working force, an always increasing amount of products is created; so does the supply of working force increase constantly, while the demand therefor decreases. This is the reason why the workers compete more and more intensely in selling themselves, causing their wages to sink, or at least on the average, never raising them above the margin necessary for keeping intact their working ability. Whilst by this process the property less are entirely debarred from entering the ranks of the propertied, even by the most strenuous exertions, the propertied, by means of the ever-increasing plundering of the working class, are becoming richer day by day, without in any way being themselves productive. If now and then one of the propertyless class become rich it is not by their own labor but from opportunities which they have to speculate upon, and absorb the labor-product of others. With the accumulation of individual wealth, the greed and power of the propertied grows. They use all the means for competing among themselves for the robbery of the people. In this struggle generally the less-propertied (middle class) are overcome, while the great capitalists, par excellence, swell their wealth enormously, concentrate entire branches of production as well as trade and intercommunication into their hands and develop into monopolists. The increase of products, accompanied by simultaneous decrease of the average income of the working mass of the people, leads to so-called “business” and “commercial” crises, when the misery of the wage-workers is forced to the extreme. For illustration: the last census of the United States shows that after deducting the cost of raw material, interest, rents, risks, etc., the propertied class have absorbed — i.e., stolen — more than five-eighths of all products, leaving scarcely three-eighths to the producers. The propertied class, being scarcely one-tenth of our population, ...in spite of their luxury and extravagance are unable to consume their enormous “profits,” and the producers, unable to consume morethan they receive — three-eighths — so-called “over-productions” must necessarily take place. The terrible results of panics are well known. The increasing eradication of working forces from the productive process annually increases the percentage of the propertyless population, which becomes pauperized and is driven to “crime,” vagabond-age, prostitution, suicide, starvation, and general depravity. This system is unjust, insane, and murderous. It is therefore necessary to totally destroy it with and by all means, and with the greatest energy on the party of everyone who suffers by it, and who does not wantto be made culpable for its continued existence by his inactivity. Agitation for the purpose of organization; organization for the purpose of rebellion. In these few wordsthe ways are marked which the workers must take if they want to be rid of their chains; as the economic condition is the same in all countries of so-called “civi-lization”; as the governments of all Monarchies and Republics work hand in hand for the purpose of opposing all movements of the thinking part of the workers; as finally the victory in the decisive combat of the proletarians against their oppressors can only be gained by the simultaneous struggle along the whole line ofthe bourgeois (capitalistic) society, so therefore the international fraternity of people as expressed in the International Working People’s Association presents itself a self-evident necessity. True order should take its place. This can only be achieved when all the implements of labor, the soil and other premises of production, in short, capital produced by labor, is changed into societary property. Only by this presupposition is destroyed every possibility of the future spoilation of man by man. Only by common, undivided capital can all be enabled to enjoy in their fullness the fruits of the common toil. Only by the impossibility of accumulating individual (pri-vate) capital can everyone be compelled to work who makes a demand to live. This order of things allows production to regulate itself according to the demand of the whole people, so that nobody need work more than a few hours a day, and that all nevertheless can satisfy their needs. Hereby time and opportunity are given for opening to the people the way to the highest possible civilization; the privileges of higher intelligence fall with the privileges of wealth and birth. To the achievement of sucha system the political organizations of the capitalistic classes — be they Monarchies or Republics — form the barriers. These political structures (States), whichare completely in the hands of the propertied, have no other purpose than the upholding of the present disorder of exploitation. All laws are directed against the working people.Insofar as the opposite appears to be the case, theyserve on the one hand to blind the worker, while onthe other hand they are simply evaded. Even the schoolserves only the purpose of furnishing the offspring ofthe wealthy with those qualities necessary to upholdtheir class domination. The children of the poor getscarcely a formal elementary training, and this, too, ismainly directed to such branches as tend to produc-ing prejudices, arrogance, and servility; in short, wantof sense. The Church finally seeks to make completeidiots out of the mass and to make them forego theparadise on earth by promising a fictitious heaven. Thecapitalistic press, on the other hand, takes care of theconfusion of spirits in public life. All these institutions,far from aiding in the education of the masses, havefor their object the keeping in ignorance of the people.They are all in the pay and under the direct control ofthe capitalistic classes. The workers can therefore ex-pect no help from any capitalistic party in their struggleagainst the existing system. They must achieve theirliberation by their own efforts. As in former times aAmerican Federation of the IWPA: “Pittsburgh Proclamation” [Oct. 1883] 3privileged class never surrendered its tyranny, neithercan it be expected that the capitalists of this age willgive up their rulership without being forced to do it.If there ever could have been any question onthis point it should long ago have been dispelled bythe brutalities of the bourgeoisie of all countries — inAmerica as well as in Europe — constantly commits,as often as the proletariat anywhere energetically moveto better their condition. It becomes, therefore, self-evident that the struggle of the proletariat with thebourgeoisie must have a violent, revolutionary char-acter.We could show by scores of illustrations that allattempts in the past to reform this monstrous systemby peaceable means, such as the ballot, have been fu-tile, and all such efforts in the future must necessarilybe so, for the following reasons:The political institutions of our time are theagencies of the propertied class; their mission is theupholding of the privileges of their masters; any re-form in your own behalf would curtail these privileges.To this they will not and cannot consent, for it wouldbe suicidal to themselves.That they will not resign their privileges volun-tarily we know; that they will not make concessionswe likewise know. Since we must then rely upon thekindness of our masters for whatever redress we have,and knowing that from them no good may be expected,there remains but one recourse — FORCE! Our fore-fathers have not only told us that against despots forceis justifiable, because it is the only means, but theythemselves have set the immemorial example.By force our ancestors liberated themselves frompolitical oppression, by force their children will haveto liberate themselves from economic bondage. “It is,therefore, your right, it is your duty,” says Jefferson —“to arm!”What we would achieve is, therefore, plainly andsimply:First:— Destruction of the existing ruling class,by all means, i.e., by energetic, relentless, revolution-ary, and international action.Second:— Establishment of a free society basedupon cooperative organization of production.Third:— Free exchange of equivalent productsby and between the productive organizations withoutcommerce and profit-mongery.Fourth:— Organization of education on a secu-lar, scientific, and equal basis for both sexes.Fifth:— Equal rights for all without distinctionto sex or race.Sixth:— Regulation of all public affairs by freecontracts between the autonomous (independent)communes and associations, resting on a federalisticbasis.Whoever agrees with this ideal, let him grasp ouroutstretched brother hands!Proletarians of all countries, unite!Fellow-workingmen, all we need for the achieve-ment of this great end is ORGANIZATION andUNITY!There exists now no great obstacle to that unity.The work of peaceful education and revolutionaryconspiracy well can and ought to run in parallel lines.The day has come for solidarity. Join our ranks!Let the drum beat defiantly the roll of battle: “Work-men of all countries unite! You have nothing to losebut your chains; you have a world to win!”Tremble, oppressors of the world! Not far be-yond your purblind sight there dawns the scarlet andsable lights of the JUDGEMENT DAY!",

Suit was brought by one Troy Mullins against the school trustees of district in Pike county, demanding the admittance of some children of whom he acted as guardian. The Pike County court denied the children admittance to the school holding that they were 'colored.' being of one-sixteenth Negro blood and under the state law prohibiting 'colored childern' from attending a white school, were therefore debarred. the case was carried to the court of appeals and the decision of that court has the effect of upholding the Pike county court and the school trustee who refused to enroll the children as pupils.",

    cardSubtitle: "First Universal Races Congress Will Mark Its Beginning",
    cardDetailedText: "London-  For the first time in human history there is a clear prospect of one ocmmon ideal animating all peoples, and thus the beautiful old hope of the brotherhood of nations and races is at last moving appreciably toward realization. What better means of celebrating the birth of the new era, of brusing aside the prejudices and suspicions or correcting misunderstandings than bymen and women from east and west, white and nonwhite, meeting as friends and equals in a great congress? We therefore earnestly appeal to all - most especially to symapthizers in the far and near east and in Africa and America - to make the utmost effor to attend personally the first universal races congress in London July 26 to 29 inclusive and convert it into an imposing and world moving demonstration in favor of interracial good will. The congress is truely what it purports to be -  an assembly of members of all the reaces of the world. Accordingly there are papers on China, Japan, Turkey, Persia, the Jewish race, India, Egypt, Haiti, the American Negro, and Indian and the Negro of West and South Africa. Hindu Scholar Will Open Program. In every one of these cases, we wish it to be noted, the paper is written by a member of the particular people or race concerned. while the very first paper of the congress is by a Hindu cholar, the congress executive recognizing that it might thus show its appreciation of the east. Ex oriente lux. It will rejoice the hearts of those who believe in interracial harmony to know that it is not the few, the despised or the eccentric who are cooperating in this congress, but the many, the honored and the experienced. Among the supporters, very many of whom have welcomed with the greatest enthusiasm the idea of holding such a congress and who belong to no less than fifty countries, are thirty presidents of parliament, the majority of the members of the permanent court of arbitration and of the delegates to the second Hague conference, twelve British governors and eight British prime ministers. many statesment and ambassadors. orver forty colonial bishops, some 130 professors of international law, the leading anthropologists and sociologists, the officers of the majority of the council of the interparlimentary union, not to particularize a multitude of other distinguished personages. Henceforth it will be impossible to deny that there exists a solid body of opinion among the most hifhly placed and most highly cultured in favor of just, respectul, and friendly relations between the peoples of the east and those of the west, between the so called whites and the so called colored, and the very remarkable unanimity in regard to fundametals among the distinguished writers of papers will emphasize this. Object and Aim of the Congress. The object of the congress, which will be held in the University of London, is to discuss in the light of modern knowledge and the modern conscience the general relations subsisting between the various peoples with a view to encouraging between them a fuller understading, the most friendly feeling and a heartoer cooperation. Political issues of the hour will be subordinated to this comprehensive end, in the firm belief that when once mutial respect is established difficulties of every type will be sympathetically approached and readily solved. We call on every one who chances to see this appeal to forward the high and holy cause of this congress by becoming a center of propoganda by attending the conference adn by inducing associations and public bodies to be represented. The American auxiliary commitee includes the names of many distinguished Americans like Jane Addams, John Grahm Brooks, President Faunce, Hamilton Holt, George Foster, Peabody, Hon, Joseph Choate, Hon Horace Porter, Lyman Abbott and Andrew Carnegie. The full program may be obtained free of charge and post free by writing to the secratary of the congress. Mr. G Spiller, 63 South Hill Park, Hampstead, London, England.

    cardDetailedText: "Washington. -(Special.)- The flurry over the disposition of the Ninth cavalry is at an end. By order of Gen. Leonard Wood, chief of staff, the colored troops will take their turn at patrolling the Mexican border and will replace the Third cavalry, relieving the latter in order that it may have a chanve to recieve instructions in the maneuver camp at San Antonio. General Carter, in command of the maneuver division, will have charge of the distribution of the Ninth cavalry, and while Sam Fordyce, Laredo, Eagle Pass, Marathon, Presidio del Notre, Marga,Hancock, Manora and other points on the Rio Grande will be covered. It is expressly stated that under no circumstances will they be sent to Brownsville, of 25th Infantry fame. The Ninth will be the divisional cavalry of the maneuver division. The war department will pay no serious attention to the howl raised by a few of the border towns, which do not want a Negro regiment 'in their midst.' Even in Washington, Post has had the generosity to say that 'it goes against the grain of a Texas white man to see a Negro in military uniform, manupulating a gun,' adding sagely that 'it has the same effect upon them as the waving of a red flag in the face of a bull.' The matter of placing the colored troops is always a delicate problem, north or south, and in this particular instance it is evident that the president and the war department are determined to do their level best too preserve the peace, maintain the dignity of the army establishment, and use the gallant Ninth according to the needs of the service, independent of the whims and absurd fears of the bourbons along the Texan frontier. No one here believes that in sturring up this racial embroglio, Representative Garner has chosen 'the better part'",

    cardSubtitle: "James R. Harris in Illinois Chronicle",
    cardDetailedText: "We have on our desk a book entitied “My Brother.” a series of essays and addresses by Dr. Amory H. Bradford. and one of the finest expositions of the doctrine of “human brotherhood” it has been our good fortune to see. With rare insight, the doctor talks of the dangers to society that follow a denial of equal chances in life to all men. regardless of class or race. He reproves The church for her failure to induce men to “practice in their lives what they profess with their lips.” and to our mind the reproof is strictly merited. There is no trouble between the races: there is no maladjustment between the weak and the strong which cannot be lessened by following the teaching of Confucius: “Do not unto others that you sould not have them do to you,” or the positive statement of the same truth by Christ: “Do unto others, that you would they should do unto you.” “The university and the pulpit.” he declares. “are the hope of the world.” This is true. Civilized men are, after all. but cultured barbarians, and the old proverb: “Scratch a Russian and find a Tartar.” is true in spirit of the great majority. We boast our enlightenment—pride ourselves upon our Intellectual and moral excellence, yet In the final analysis, things are largely in the bands of the brass-buttoned gentleman who stands on the corner with a club or a black jack in his hand. True it is, that we have taken the rings out of our noses and we no longer paint (that is, most of us), yet in our treatment of the weak and the helpless we still believe In that good old rule, the simple plan: “That they may take who have the power, And they may Keep, who can.” We have just received the third of the series of monographs being published by the American Negro Monograph company, Washington, D.C. Its theme is-the life of Benjamin Banneker, the great negro mathematician, who did so much to dispel doubt of the negro’s mental capacity in the eighteenth century, and who was not only a recipient of letters of admiration and encouragement from Thomas Jefferson, but also an honored guest at the executive mansion during the administration of that great man. Without any of the numerous tables and other astronomical data, which must go so far toward lessening the diffculties of such a task, Mr Banneker compiled an almanac for the year 1732, which feat won the applause of many of the lending scientists of the day. He later sent a copy In the original manuscript to President Jefferson and accompanied it with a letter from which we quote: “Sir—I am fully sensible of the greatness of that freedom which I now. take with you on the present occasion, a liberty which seemed to me scarcely allowable. when I reflected on that distinguished and dignified station In which you stand, and the almost general prejudice and prepossession which is prevalent in the world against those of my complexion. I suppose it is a truth too well attested to you to need a proof here, that we are a race of beings who have long labored under the abuse and censure of the world; that we have long been considered as brutish rather than human and scarcely capable of mental endowments. Sir, I hope I may safely admit, in consequence of report which hath reached me, that you are a man far less inflexible in sentiments of this nature than many others; that you are measurably friendly and well disposed toward us. and that you are ready and willing to lend your aid and assistance to our relief from those many distressed and numerous calamlties to which we are reduced. Sir—I suppose that your knowledge of the situation of my brethren is too extensivé to need a recital here; neither shall I presume to prescribe methods by which they may be relieved. otherwise than by recommending to you and all others to wean yourselves from those narrow prejudices which you have imbibed with respect to them and as Job propored to his friends. Put your souls in their souls instead. thus shall your hearts be enlarged with kindness and benevolence toward them, and thus shall you need neither the directicn of myself nor others in what manner to proceed therein. This calculation sir is the production of my arduous study in this my advanced stage of life; for having long had unbounded desires to become acquainted with the secrets of nature, I have had to gratify my curiosity herein through my own assiduous applicaiton of astronomical study, in which I need not to recount to you the many difficulties and disadvantages I have had to encounter. We have qunted the letter at length that the reader may get an Idea of the very intelligent way in which this self-taught negro expressed himself. Banneker died in 1804 and no marked shaft marks the site of his resting place: we mention this fact with shame. A people's character is interpereted int terms of its appreciation for its great men, and we hope the day is not far distant when our its whose name Benjamin Bannker lived and wrought, may in some way show their gratitude by distinguishing the spot of bis burial. The ten best-selling books in. fiction for 1910 were the following: The Rosary. A Modern Chroticle When a Man Marries, John Marvel. Thruxton King. The Silver Horde. Lord Loveland Discovers America. The Kingdom of Slender Swords. Simon the Jester and ‘Nathan Burke.” It is interesting to note that of the thirty “best sellers,” nineteen were written by men and eleven by women. Of course, being a “best seller” does not make a book Literature, yet popolarity does not imply a lack of merit and most of. the above given list will repay perusal. In one of the magazines we read an article on “The New Japan,” in which was expresséd great concern over the rapid growth in power and prestige which the island-empire has made in the last half century. Occldegtal nations are justified in, their speculations about Japan’s future. Suppose, for Instance, that she finds it possible to arouse the Chinese from their sleep of centuries, and to inspire them with their own dynamic energies—think, reader, what a power this yellow empire might become! Some idea of the enormous population of China can be formed when we remember that if we could place all the men in the world side by side in one long ine, first an Englishman, then an American, ete. every fourth man would be a Chinaman. One of the sources of Oriental strength !a their impenetrability—the occidental mind cannot see behind the mask, or as Kipling puts it: “It is not good for the Christian race To worry the Aryan “brown, For the white man riles, And the brown man smiles, And it weareth the Christian down; Andghe énd of thé fight Is a tombstone white With the name of the late deceased, And the epitaph clear, “A fool lies here Who tried to hurry the east.” Or as another writer who also knows his subject, puts it 'The brooding east with awe beheld Her, impious younger world; The Roman tempest swelled and swelled. And on her head was hurled. The east bow'd low before the blast, In patient. deep disdain; ‘She let the legions thunder past And plunged in thought again,' The recent magnificent showing by the negroes of Chicago in raising so great a sum of money for the Y. M. C. A. movement simply proves conclusively that in this city the brains and wealth of the race is to be found. This one incident has done more to raise our people in the estimation of the world than all the editorials ever written. A people who can in ten days secure $66,000 for any given purpose must be reckoned with. When we remember that our people are wage earners largely, and often for policy’s sake, are deterred in making large contributions to public enterprises, even when able so to do, the result of this effort is all the more commendable. We thought we were doing a great thing here in Louisville in attempting to raise $15,000, but we take off our hats to Chicago, promising to be in the future.",

    cardDetailedText: "About 350 members of the race responded to the call of the American Federation of Labor invitation to be present at a meeting at Labor Temple on last Sunday for the purpose or taking steps to become affiliated with that organization. The large gathering and the interest manifested certainly showed the colored man is always ready to grasp even at a straw at it were to join hands with his white brother in any good movement that has for its object the uplift of all people. The meeting was called to order by Mr. Flynn, whose sincerity in his deaire to do the square thing by the colored brother, we hare no reason to doubt. Fiynn Opens Doors to Colored Men. He said the doors of the American Federation of Labor were opened to the colored men and that while in some parts of the country a feeling existed against admitting the colored men, the only way to break down the doors of those still opposing was to get colored men to join the American Federation in places where this feeling does not exist. We cannot expect great things from the start, and it may take a year or two to bring a complete affiliation in all organizations with the colored race. Irish Had Struggle Too. He cited the hardships of his own race, the Irish, whom his mother said, used to be stoned. Now it was up to them to try to educate the colored man and white man to realize the brotherhood of man. You will find the colored brother now in many parts of the country in the counsels of labor organizations as delegates. At the last international convention held here at the Monongahela house, a colored man from Youngstown represented the brickmakers association of that city. McCulfough Lauds Black Man's Efforts .Mr. J. W. McCullough, an ex-president of the United Mine Workers, followed with a vary forcible and impressive speech that showed that his heart was in the right place. He hit right from the shoudder and received much applause for his manly utterances. He spoke of the many wrongs that hed been perpetrated upon the black man, told how they had been brought to this country as slaves. He said the laboring man was now in a wage system of slavery, but the condition of employment today should be this, if you have more knowledge than I, you will be employed and if I have more knowledge than you, I will be employed. The question that is asked today is what is the price? They do not ask Whether it was made by a White man or back man. It is now a question of reaching down to help the other fellow up and as you rise you can help to elevate others of your race. He spoke of the great progress the colored race had made in its ten years of freedom, and is taking its place along side of the white man in all walks of life. if what the race has accomplished in about 10 years is to be considered. you ought to be able to double what you have done within the next 20 years. In fact, there is no limit to the possibilities of the colored man. You will be respected according to what you do for yourself. He said the race has been too contented with work for low wages True, there are places where white men will not work with colored men, but those white men cannot but realize soonor or later that they will be the loosers, and will be brought to see the folly of their position. We all need to get on the same broad platform that knows no creed, color, or nationality and raise the highest standard we can set for each other. Geo. M. Robb Joins Heartily. Mr. Geo. Robb followed with a short speech .to the point. He said he was willing to take a chance and join the American Federation! and that we as colored citizens, have always Been loyal to every movement that the white man has put forward that had for its object the uplift of mankind. While we have been known. as strike breakers, it has been because we could never heretofore be strike makers, but that wé now feel that the Divine hand that carries the destiny of nations has put it into the hands of these men to have us be come part of this great industrial body. The question is. Are we to now members, and is only a question be recognized and acorded the same protection as the white brother! And will your motto be ‘I am my brothers keeper?' We don't want to be used at 'cat’s paws' to pull you out of the fire. Mr. Flynn replied that it was a very difficult problem to get all the white People to think alone. The American Federation of Labor has been advocating for 20 years the same privilege to the colored man as to the white and in fact no organization can affiliate with the American Federation of Labor and exclude the colored man. There are quite a few craftr at present in which the colored men are of time until unions will admit them, What we want to do today Is to get you properly organized and if you have any particular trade to transfer you to your respective organization and if you are not have no particular trade you will become affiliated directly with the American Federation of Labor. We want to see If your people are sincere and while we realize that it is going to take a year of two to get everything in good order and get the results deserved by all, you can start out today for the foundation of this organization. Organization Effected. Mr. N. W. Rickmond was eiected temporary chairman, and a better selection could not have been made. After several declinations Mr. Thos. Wilson was: elected temporary secretary. Mr. Flynn stated the charter would cost $10 and membership fee should be ai least 50 cents. Mr. Geo. Robb, the well known and popular proprietor of the Colonial hotel, whose heart is as big as his body. said he would defray the expense of the charter and present it free to the organization and when the temporary orsanization was effected his $10 was forthcoming. At this meeting a good number of names was enrolled for membership and adout half of the men paid their 50 cents, There will be another meeting at the Labor Temple next Sunday at 2 p.m. Every colored man who has any, race pride and wants to do something for the advancement of his race along industrial lines should be present at that meeting. We cannot see how you have anything to lose and if the promoters of this movement are sincere in their efforts to play fair with the colored man, the race and the American Federation of labor will both reap the benefit. It is certainly worth a fair trial.",
