    cardTitle: "The “Pittsburgh Proclamation.”",
    cardSubtitle: "Adopted by the Founding Congress of the American Federation of the International Working People’s Association",
    cardDetailedText:"Comrades! In the Declaration of Independence of the United States we read: When a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Has the moment not arrived to heed the advice of Thomas Jefferson, the true founder of the American Republic? Has government not become oppression? And is our government anything but a conspiracy of the ruling classes against the people — against you? Comrades! Hear what he have to say. Read our manifesto, written in your interest and for the welfare of your wives and children and toward the good of humanity and progress. Our present society is founded upon the exploitation of the propertyless class by the propertied. This exploitation is such that the propertied (capitalists) but the working force body and soul of the propertyless, for the price of the mere cost of existence (wages) and take for themselves, i.e., steal the amount of new values (products) which exceeds the price, whereby wagesare made to represent the necessities instead of the earnings of the wage-laborer. As the non-possessing classes are forced by their poverty to offer for sale to the propertied their working forces, and as our present production on a grandscale enforces technical development with immense rapidity, so that by the application of an always decreasing number of human working force, an always increasing amount of products is created; so does the supply of working force increase constantly, while the demand therefor decreases. This is the reason why the workers compete more and more intensely in selling themselves, causing their wages to sink, or at least on the average, never raising them above the margin necessary for keeping intact their working ability. Whilst by this process the property less are entirely debarred from entering the ranks of the propertied, even by the most strenuous exertions, the propertied, by means of the ever-increasing plundering of the working class, are becoming richer day by day, without in any way being themselves productive. If now and then one of the propertyless class become rich it is not by their own labor but from opportunities which they have to speculate upon, and absorb the labor-product of others. With the accumulation of individual wealth, the greed and power of the propertied grows. They use all the means for competing among themselves for the robbery of the people. In this struggle generally the less-propertied (middle class) are overcome, while the great capitalists, par excellence, swell their wealth enormously, concentrate entire branches of production as well as trade and intercommunication into their hands and develop into monopolists. The increase of products, accompanied by simultaneous decrease of the average income of the working mass of the people, leads to so-called “business” and “commercial” crises, when the misery of the wage-workers is forced to the extreme. For illustration: the last census of the United States shows that after deducting the cost of raw material, interest, rents, risks, etc., the propertied class have absorbed — i.e., stolen — more than five-eighths of all products, leaving scarcely three-eighths to the producers. The propertied class, being scarcely one-tenth of our population, ...in spite of their luxury and extravagance are unable to consume their enormous “profits,” and the producers, unable to consume morethan they receive — three-eighths — so-called “over-productions” must necessarily take place. The terrible results of panics are well known. The increasing eradication of working forces from the productive process annually increases the percentage of the propertyless population, which becomes pauperized and is driven to “crime,” vagabond-age, prostitution, suicide, starvation, and general depravity. This system is unjust, insane, and murderous. It is therefore necessary to totally destroy it with and by all means, and with the greatest energy on the party of everyone who suffers by it, and who does not wantto be made culpable for its continued existence by his inactivity. Agitation for the purpose of organization; organization for the purpose of rebellion. In these few wordsthe ways are marked which the workers must take if they want to be rid of their chains; as the economic condition is the same in all countries of so-called “civi-lization”; as the governments of all Monarchies and Republics work hand in hand for the purpose of opposing all movements of the thinking part of the workers; as finally the victory in the decisive combat of the proletarians against their oppressors can only be gained by the simultaneous struggle along the whole line ofthe bourgeois (capitalistic) society, so therefore the international fraternity of people as expressed in the International Working People’s Association presents itself a self-evident necessity. True order should take its place. This can only be achieved when all the implements of labor, the soil and other premises of production, in short, capital produced by labor, is changed into societary property. Only by this presupposition is destroyed every possibility of the future spoilation of man by man. Only by common, undivided capital can all be enabled to enjoy in their fullness the fruits of the common toil. Only by the impossibility of accumulating individual (pri-vate) capital can everyone be compelled to work who makes a demand to live. This order of things allows production to regulate itself according to the demand of the whole people, so that nobody need work more than a few hours a day, and that all nevertheless can satisfy their needs. Hereby time and opportunity are given for opening to the people the way to the highest possible civilization; the privileges of higher intelligence fall with the privileges of wealth and birth. To the achievement of sucha system the political organizations of the capitalistic classes — be they Monarchies or Republics — form the barriers. These political structures (States), whichare completely in the hands of the propertied, have no other purpose than the upholding of the present disorder of exploitation. All laws are directed against the working people.Insofar as the opposite appears to be the case, theyserve on the one hand to blind the worker, while onthe other hand they are simply evaded. Even the schoolserves only the purpose of furnishing the offspring ofthe wealthy with those qualities necessary to upholdtheir class domination. The children of the poor getscarcely a formal elementary training, and this, too, ismainly directed to such branches as tend to produc-ing prejudices, arrogance, and servility; in short, wantof sense. The Church finally seeks to make completeidiots out of the mass and to make them forego theparadise on earth by promising a fictitious heaven. Thecapitalistic press, on the other hand, takes care of theconfusion of spirits in public life. All these institutions,far from aiding in the education of the masses, havefor their object the keeping in ignorance of the people.They are all in the pay and under the direct control ofthe capitalistic classes. The workers can therefore ex-pect no help from any capitalistic party in their struggleagainst the existing system. They must achieve theirliberation by their own efforts. As in former times aAmerican Federation of the IWPA: “Pittsburgh Proclamation” [Oct. 1883] 3privileged class never surrendered its tyranny, neithercan it be expected that the capitalists of this age willgive up their rulership without being forced to do it.If there ever could have been any question onthis point it should long ago have been dispelled bythe brutalities of the bourgeoisie of all countries — inAmerica as well as in Europe — constantly commits,as often as the proletariat anywhere energetically moveto better their condition. It becomes, therefore, self-evident that the struggle of the proletariat with thebourgeoisie must have a violent, revolutionary char-acter.We could show by scores of illustrations that allattempts in the past to reform this monstrous systemby peaceable means, such as the ballot, have been fu-tile, and all such efforts in the future must necessarilybe so, for the following reasons:The political institutions of our time are theagencies of the propertied class; their mission is theupholding of the privileges of their masters; any re-form in your own behalf would curtail these privileges.To this they will not and cannot consent, for it wouldbe suicidal to themselves.That they will not resign their privileges volun-tarily we know; that they will not make concessionswe likewise know. Since we must then rely upon thekindness of our masters for whatever redress we have,and knowing that from them no good may be expected,there remains but one recourse — FORCE! Our fore-fathers have not only told us that against despots forceis justifiable, because it is the only means, but theythemselves have set the immemorial example.By force our ancestors liberated themselves frompolitical oppression, by force their children will haveto liberate themselves from economic bondage. “It is,therefore, your right, it is your duty,” says Jefferson —“to arm!”What we would achieve is, therefore, plainly andsimply:First:— Destruction of the existing ruling class,by all means, i.e., by energetic, relentless, revolution-ary, and international action.Second:— Establishment of a free society basedupon cooperative organization of production.Third:— Free exchange of equivalent productsby and between the productive organizations withoutcommerce and profit-mongery.Fourth:— Organization of education on a secu-lar, scientific, and equal basis for both sexes.Fifth:— Equal rights for all without distinctionto sex or race.Sixth:— Regulation of all public affairs by freecontracts between the autonomous (independent)communes and associations, resting on a federalisticbasis.Whoever agrees with this ideal, let him grasp ouroutstretched brother hands!Proletarians of all countries, unite!Fellow-workingmen, all we need for the achieve-ment of this great end is ORGANIZATION andUNITY!There exists now no great obstacle to that unity.The work of peaceful education and revolutionaryconspiracy well can and ought to run in parallel lines.The day has come for solidarity. Join our ranks!Let the drum beat defiantly the roll of battle: “Work-men of all countries unite! You have nothing to losebut your chains; you have a world to win!”Tremble, oppressors of the world! Not far be-yond your purblind sight there dawns the scarlet andsable lights of the JUDGEMENT DAY!",

Suit was brought by one Troy Mullins against the school trustees of district in Pike county, demanding the admittance of some children of whom he acted as guardian. The Pike County court denied the children admittance to the school holding that they were 'colored.' being of one-sixteenth Negro blood and under the state law prohibiting 'colored childern' from attending a white school, were therefore debarred. the case was carried to the court of appeals and the decision of that court has the effect of upholding the Pike county court and the school trustee who refused to enroll the children as pupils.",

    cardSubtitle: "First Universal Races Congress Will Mark Its Beginning",
    cardDetailedText: "London-  For the first time in human history there is a clear prospect of one ocmmon ideal animating all peoples, and thus the beautiful old hope of the brotherhood of nations and races is at last moving appreciably toward realization. What better means of celebrating the birth of the new era, of brusing aside the prejudices and suspicions or correcting misunderstandings than bymen and women from east and west, white and nonwhite, meeting as friends and equals in a great congress? We therefore earnestly appeal to all - most especially to symapthizers in the far and near east and in Africa and America - to make the utmost effor to attend personally the first universal races congress in London July 26 to 29 inclusive and convert it into an imposing and world moving demonstration in favor of interracial good will. The congress is truely what it purports to be -  an assembly of members of all the reaces of the world. Accordingly there are papers on China, Japan, Turkey, Persia, the Jewish race, India, Egypt, Haiti, the American Negro, and Indian and the Negro of West and South Africa. Hindu Scholar Will Open Program. In every one of these cases, we wish it to be noted, the paper is written by a member of the particular people or race concerned. while the very first paper of the congress is by a Hindu cholar, the congress executive recognizing that it might thus show its appreciation of the east. Ex oriente lux. It will rejoice the hearts of those who believe in interracial harmony to know that it is not the few, the despised or the eccentric who are cooperating in this congress, but the many, the honored and the experienced. Among the supporters, very many of whom have welcomed with the greatest enthusiasm the idea of holding such a congress and who belong to no less than fifty countries, are thirty presidents of parliament, the majority of the members of the permanent court of arbitration and of the delegates to the second Hague conference, twelve British governors and eight British prime ministers. many statesment and ambassadors. orver forty colonial bishops, some 130 professors of international law, the leading anthropologists and sociologists, the officers of the majority of the council of the interparlimentary union, not to particularize a multitude of other distinguished personages. Henceforth it will be impossible to deny that there exists a solid body of opinion among the most hifhly placed and most highly cultured in favor of just, respectul, and friendly relations between the peoples of the east and those of the west, between the so called whites and the so called colored, and the very remarkable unanimity in regard to fundametals among the distinguished writers of papers will emphasize this. Object and Aim of the Congress. The object of the congress, which will be held in the University of London, is to discuss in the light of modern knowledge and the modern conscience the general relations subsisting between the various peoples with a view to encouraging between them a fuller understading, the most friendly feeling and a heartoer cooperation. Political issues of the hour will be subordinated to this comprehensive end, in the firm belief that when once mutial respect is established difficulties of every type will be sympathetically approached and readily solved. We call on every one who chances to see this appeal to forward the high and holy cause of this congress by becoming a center of propoganda by attending the conference adn by inducing associations and public bodies to be represented. The American auxiliary commitee includes the names of many distinguished Americans like Jane Addams, John Grahm Brooks, President Faunce, Hamilton Holt, George Foster, Peabody, Hon, Joseph Choate, Hon Horace Porter, Lyman Abbott and Andrew Carnegie. The full program may be obtained free of charge and post free by writing to the secratary of the congress. Mr. G Spiller, 63 South Hill Park, Hampstead, London, England.

    cardDetailedText: "Washington. -(Special.)- The flurry over the disposition of the Ninth cavalry is at an end. By order of Gen. Leonard Wood, chief of staff, the colored troops will take their turn at patrolling the Mexican border and will replace the Third cavalry, relieving the latter in order that it may have a chanve to recieve instructions in the maneuver camp at San Antonio. General Carter, in command of the maneuver division, will have charge of the distribution of the Ninth cavalry, and while Sam Fordyce, Laredo, Eagle Pass, Marathon, Presidio del Notre, Marga,Hancock, Manora and other points on the Rio Grande will be covered. It is expressly stated that under no circumstances will they be sent to Brownsville, of 25th Infantry fame. The Ninth will be the divisional cavalry of the maneuver division. The war department will pay no serious attention to the howl raised by a few of the border towns, which do not want a Negro regiment 'in their midst.' Even in Washington, Post has had the generosity to say that 'it goes against the grain of a Texas white man to see a Negro in military uniform, manupulating a gun,' adding sagely that 'it has the same effect upon them as the waving of a red flag in the face of a bull.' The matter of placing the colored troops is always a delicate problem, north or south, and in this particular instance it is evident that the president and the war department are determined to do their level best too preserve the peace, maintain the dignity of the army establishment, and use the gallant Ninth according to the needs of the service, independent of the whims and absurd fears of the bourbons along the Texan frontier. No one here believes that in sturring up this racial embroglio, Representative Garner has chosen 'the better part'",

    cardSubtitle: "James R. Harris in Illinois Chronicle",
    cardDetailedText: "We have on our desk a book entitied “My Brother.” a series of essays and addresses by Dr. Amory H. Bradford. and one of the finest expositions of the doctrine of “human brotherhood” it has been our good fortune to see. With rare insight, the doctor talks of the dangers to society that follow a denial of equal chances in life to all men. regardless of class or race. He reproves The church for her failure to induce men to “practice in their lives what they profess with their lips.” and to our mind the reproof is strictly merited. There is no trouble between the races: there is no maladjustment between the weak and the strong which cannot be lessened by following the teaching of Confucius: “Do not unto others that you sould not have them do to you,” or the positive statement of the same truth by Christ: “Do unto others, that you would they should do unto you.” “The university and the pulpit.” he declares. “are the hope of the world.” This is true. Civilized men are, after all. but cultured barbarians, and the old proverb: “Scratch a Russian and find a Tartar.” is true in spirit of the great majority. We boast our enlightenment—pride ourselves upon our Intellectual and moral excellence, yet In the final analysis, things are largely in the bands of the brass-buttoned gentleman who stands on the corner with a club or a black jack in his hand. True it is, that we have taken the rings out of our noses and we no longer paint (that is, most of us), yet in our treatment of the weak and the helpless we still believe In that good old rule, the simple plan: “That they may take who have the power, And they may Keep, who can.” We have just received the third of the series of monographs being published by the American Negro Monograph company, Washington, D.C. Its theme is-the life of Benjamin Banneker, the great negro mathematician, who did so much to dispel doubt of the negro’s mental capacity in the eighteenth century, and who was not only a recipient of letters of admiration and encouragement from Thomas Jefferson, but also an honored guest at the executive mansion during the administration of that great man. Without any of the numerous tables and other astronomical data, which must go so far toward lessening the diffculties of such a task, Mr Banneker compiled an almanac for the year 1732, which feat won the applause of many of the lending scientists of the day. He later sent a copy In the original manuscript to President Jefferson and accompanied it with a letter from which we quote: “Sir—I am fully sensible of the greatness of that freedom which I now. take with you on the present occasion, a liberty which seemed to me scarcely allowable. when I reflected on that distinguished and dignified station In which you stand, and the almost general prejudice and prepossession which is prevalent in the world against those of my complexion. I suppose it is a truth too well attested to you to need a proof here, that we are a race of beings who have long labored under the abuse and censure of the world; that we have long been considered as brutish rather than human and scarcely capable of mental endowments. Sir, I hope I may safely admit, in consequence of report which hath reached me, that you are a man far less inflexible in sentiments of this nature than many others; that you are measurably friendly and well disposed toward us. and that you are ready and willing to lend your aid and assistance to our relief from those many distressed and numerous calamlties to which we are reduced. Sir—I suppose that your knowledge of the situation of my brethren is too extensivé to need a recital here; neither shall I presume to prescribe methods by which they may be relieved. otherwise than by recommending to you and all others to wean yourselves from those narrow prejudices which you have imbibed with respect to them and as Job propored to his friends. Put your souls in their souls instead. thus shall your hearts be enlarged with kindness and benevolence toward them, and thus shall you need neither the directicn of myself nor others in what manner to proceed therein. This calculation sir is the production of my arduous study in this my advanced stage of life; for having long had unbounded desires to become acquainted with the secrets of nature, I have had to gratify my curiosity herein through my own assiduous applicaiton of astronomical study, in which I need not to recount to you the many difficulties and disadvantages I have had to encounter. We have qunted the letter at length that the reader may get an Idea of the very intelligent way in which this self-taught negro expressed himself. Banneker died in 1804 and no marked shaft marks the site of his resting place: we mention this fact with shame. A people's character is interpereted int terms of its appreciation for its great men, and we hope the day is not far distant when our its whose name Benjamin Bannker lived and wrought, may in some way show their gratitude by distinguishing the spot of bis burial. The ten best-selling books in. fiction for 1910 were the following: The Rosary. A Modern Chroticle When a Man Marries, John Marvel. Thruxton King. The Silver Horde. Lord Loveland Discovers America. The Kingdom of Slender Swords. Simon the Jester and ‘Nathan Burke.” It is interesting to note that of the thirty “best sellers,” nineteen were written by men and eleven by women. Of course, being a “best seller” does not make a book Literature, yet popolarity does not imply a lack of merit and most of. the above given list will repay perusal. In one of the magazines we read an article on “The New Japan,” in which was expresséd great concern over the rapid growth in power and prestige which the island-empire has made in the last half century. Occldegtal nations are justified in, their speculations about Japan’s future. Suppose, for Instance, that she finds it possible to arouse the Chinese from their sleep of centuries, and to inspire them with their own dynamic energies—think, reader, what a power this yellow empire might become! Some idea of the enormous population of China can be formed when we remember that if we could place all the men in the world side by side in one long ine, first an Englishman, then an American, ete. every fourth man would be a Chinaman. One of the sources of Oriental strength !a their impenetrability—the occidental mind cannot see behind the mask, or as Kipling puts it: “It is not good for the Christian race To worry the Aryan “brown, For the white man riles, And the brown man smiles, And it weareth the Christian down; Andghe énd of thé fight Is a tombstone white With the name of the late deceased, And the epitaph clear, “A fool lies here Who tried to hurry the east.” Or as another writer who also knows his subject, puts it 'The brooding east with awe beheld Her, impious younger world; The Roman tempest swelled and swelled. And on her head was hurled. The east bow'd low before the blast, In patient. deep disdain; ‘She let the legions thunder past And plunged in thought again,' The recent magnificent showing by the negroes of Chicago in raising so great a sum of money for the Y. M. C. A. movement simply proves conclusively that in this city the brains and wealth of the race is to be found. This one incident has done more to raise our people in the estimation of the world than all the editorials ever written. A people who can in ten days secure $66,000 for any given purpose must be reckoned with. When we remember that our people are wage earners largely, and often for policy’s sake, are deterred in making large contributions to public enterprises, even when able so to do, the result of this effort is all the more commendable. We thought we were doing a great thing here in Louisville in attempting to raise $15,000, but we take off our hats to Chicago, promising to be in the future.",

    cardSubtitle: "Large Attendance at First Meeting in Labor Temple Last Sunday",
    cardDetailedText: "About 350 members of the race responded to the call of the American Federation of Labor invitation to be present at a meeting at Labor Temple on last Sunday for the purpose or taking steps to become affiliated with that organization. The large gathering and the interest manifested certainly showed the colored man is always ready to grasp even at a straw at it were to join hands with his white brother in any good movement that has for its object the uplift of all people. The meeting was called to order by Mr. Flynn, whose sincerity in his deaire to do the square thing by the colored brother, we hare no reason to doubt. Fiynn Opens Doors to Colored Men. He said the doors of the American Federation of Labor were opened to the colored men and that while in some parts of the country a feeling existed against admitting the colored men, the only way to break down the doors of those still opposing was to get colored men to join the American Federation in places where this feeling does not exist. We cannot expect great things from the start, and it may take a year or two to bring a complete affiliation in all organizations with the colored race. Irish Had Struggle Too. He cited the hardships of his own race, the Irish, whom his mother said, used to be stoned. Now it was up to them to try to educate the colored man and white man to realize the brotherhood of man. You will find the colored brother now in many parts of the country in the counsels of labor organizations as delegates. At the last international convention held here at the Monongahela house, a colored man from Youngstown represented the brickmakers association of that city. McCulfough Lauds Black Man's Efforts .Mr. J. W. McCullough, an ex-president of the United Mine Workers, followed with a vary forcible and impressive speech that showed that his heart was in the right place. He hit right from the shoudder and received much applause for his manly utterances. He spoke of the many wrongs that hed been perpetrated upon the black man, told how they had been brought to this country as slaves. He said the laboring man was now in a wage system of slavery, but the condition of employment today should be this, if you have more knowledge than I, you will be employed and if I have more knowledge than you, I will be employed. The question that is asked today is what is the price? They do not ask Whether it was made by a White man or back man. It is now a question of reaching down to help the other fellow up and as you rise you can help to elevate others of your race. He spoke of the great progress the colored race had made in its ten years of freedom, and is taking its place along side of the white man in all walks of life. if what the race has accomplished in about 10 years is to be considered. you ought to be able to double what you have done within the next 20 years. In fact, there is no limit to the possibilities of the colored man. You will be respected according to what you do for yourself. He said the race has been too contented with work for low wages True, there are places where white men will not work with colored men, but those white men cannot but realize soonor or later that they will be the loosers, and will be brought to see the folly of their position. We all need to get on the same broad platform that knows no creed, color, or nationality and raise the highest standard we can set for each other. Geo. M. Robb Joins Heartily. Mr. Geo. Robb followed with a short speech .to the point. He said he was willing to take a chance and join the American Federation! and that we as colored citizens, have always Been loyal to every movement that the white man has put forward that had for its object the uplift of mankind. While we have been known. as strike breakers, it has been because we could never heretofore be strike makers, but that wé now feel that the Divine hand that carries the destiny of nations has put it into the hands of these men to have us be come part of this great industrial body. The question is. Are we to now members, and is only a question be recognized and acorded the same protection as the white brother! And will your motto be ‘I am my brothers keeper?' We don't want to be used at 'cat’s paws' to pull you out of the fire. Mr. Flynn replied that it was a very difficult problem to get all the white People to think alone. The American Federation of Labor has been advocating for 20 years the same privilege to the colored man as to the white and in fact no organization can affiliate with the American Federation of Labor and exclude the colored man. There are quite a few craftr at present in which the colored men are of time until unions will admit them, What we want to do today Is to get you properly organized and if you have any particular trade to transfer you to your respective organization and if you are not have no particular trade you will become affiliated directly with the American Federation of Labor. We want to see If your people are sincere and while we realize that it is going to take a year of two to get everything in good order and get the results deserved by all, you can start out today for the foundation of this organization. Organization Effected. Mr. N. W. Rickmond was eiected temporary chairman, and a better selection could not have been made. After several declinations Mr. Thos. Wilson was: elected temporary secretary. Mr. Flynn stated the charter would cost $10 and membership fee should be ai least 50 cents. Mr. Geo. Robb, the well known and popular proprietor of the Colonial hotel, whose heart is as big as his body. said he would defray the expense of the charter and present it free to the organization and when the temporary orsanization was effected his $10 was forthcoming. At this meeting a good number of names was enrolled for membership and adout half of the men paid their 50 cents, There will be another meeting at the Labor Temple next Sunday at 2 p.m. Every colored man who has any, race pride and wants to do something for the advancement of his race along industrial lines should be present at that meeting. We cannot see how you have anything to lose and if the promoters of this movement are sincere in their efforts to play fair with the colored man, the race and the American Federation of labor will both reap the benefit. It is certainly worth a fair trial.",

    cardDetailedText: "In looking’ over and studying the various mission fields of the world, our hearts are made to feel sad over the deplorable condition of parts of the human race. The sad tales of India, China and other races, draw forth our deeper sympathy, but when we come to the dark continent of Africa. it is here we take our stand, it is here we hang our harps upon the willow tree and weep because of the woeful condition. and great need of our black brother. The Indian mother throws her baby into the angry river to appease the wrath of her god, the Chinaman bows down,to his image of wood, Mohammedism Claims other worshipers, but when we see the poor black man bound in ignorance, cannibalism, and superstition we feel the great responsibility that rests on us as a part of the human race. Yet all Africa is not dark and benighted. some parts are civilized and the natives are christianized. but that is not the part that needs our help worst. We would find the souls in darkness lying. where no light has broken through. And we need only to look in Darker Africa to find these souls: men and women, boys and. girls who have never heard of the Saviour. whose condition is pitiful to behold. They are ignorant, without raiment and living in superstition, uncivilized: some are cannibals living in rush villages or roaming the forest; all human beings that fall prey to them are cooked and eaten. They believe in devils, Witchery, evil omens: if a snake crawls Into one’s hut the snake is a harbinger of evil. If a native dies his spirit goes into a hog or some wild animal. And yet with all their savagery they are a people that are . willing and eager to learn of His love so deep and dear of the precious price that -------- of the nail, the thorn the spear. Their need is great and we cannot deny them the light of life. civilization must spread over this dark land, Their first great need is the Gospel. let them have the light of salvation. Learn of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. Noble men and women have answered the call of the wild; they have gone forth to plant the blood stained banner of Christ to drive out the superstition to banish death and darkness. but it is not easy sailing. There are dangers and hardships to be encountered is counted not precious. How many today sleep under African sod? Their work was not in vain they struck a blow to African heathenism that made it better. Now it is beginning to fall. soon it will crumble. They have sown the seed of religon, others will reap the harvest they have gone to reap their reward. As we have done it unto these the least of them brethren, ye have done it unto me. But have we conscientiously helped to suppiy the needs of this people? Thousands of dollars. Bibles, books, clothes, men and women. are given to the cause. How great the supply, yet the demand is greater: we still hear the cry. 'come over and help us.' First give them the Gospel, then houses of worship and then schools where they can be taught thrift, industry and skill. instead of the rush hut, build houses. instead of roaming as savages. till the soil To do all this there must be means. The missionary of the field sees the great need and appeals to civilized America to help. Let us look back, over the past three hundred years. We see twenty trembling bound Negroes carried to New York dock and sold as slaves. As the years advance. they increase to hundreds—thousands—to millions. and broad east over the land. It seems hard that they should have suffered the bitterness and gall of slavery. Yet it was God's hand in it all. Suffered it to be so that we as a mass. might be civilized and christianized to better help our fellow man across the ocean. Why was Moses reared in the house of Pharaoh? Why was he taught the fine arts and given such high training? It was God's plan, that he might better lead and help the people, Then we are Zion. the chosen of God. Chosen to do a great work, chosen to save from peril of perdition the souls for whom Christ died, the instrumants of God's hand. We are all missionaries of the Christian religion, pledged to help our fellow men There are, many ways in which we can help spread the gospel. Give of our means, give our young men and women give our prayers and tears. give ourselves. Then while we are Kneeling worshiping God, under our own vine and fig tree, let us not forget the poor African boys and girls that Rev. East spoke of in his letter. without clothes, without a place of worship. and althougd we cannot give thousands, let us give in proportion as God has given to us to help him in hss great work. You that have not been roused to the sense of your duty, do so before it is too late and 'Haste spread the tiding Wide to earth’s remotest strand Let no brothers bitter chidings Rise against you when you stand In the Judgement From some far forgotten land'. The sudject of this sketch was born at Washington, D. C. August 29, 1872, where he spent his early years. He was converted to the Christian faith when fourteen years old and was baptized by Rev. Dr. R. V. Peyton in the Potomac river. Rev. Saunders attended the public school at his native home and received a fair education. Realizing his call to the gospel ministry he made it known to his pastor, the Rev. R. V. Payton, who gave him an opportunity to preach at a trial sermon. After preaching forsome time a council was called to consider the advisibility of ordaining him. Failing to meet the requirements of the council he was requested to study a little more and then try again in two months time. Prurposing to be able to satisfy the next council this young man worked hard at his trade as brickmaking and studied at night. Some time was spent With a private teacher. Things became slow at Washington D.C. in line of work knowing that he had a wife and three little ones to take care of he moved to Philadelphia Pa., where he and his wife worked and saved a few dollars. Leaving Philadelphia he came back to Washington D. C. After spending what little they had accumulated he set sail for Pittsburgh. he was called to the Central Baptist church to succeed the Rey. Dr. F. G. Bookins, feeling that he was able to meet the requirements a council was called July 11, 1905, to consider his ordination. Rev A. W. Puller catechiser, Rev. Dr. R. R. Jones, moderator and Rev. Dr. W. W. Brown secretary. Rev. Saunders received an impartial examination and was ordained. Rev. Dr. Pulier preached his ordination sermon. This young man has pastored several small churches in Pittsburgh, Pa. and vicinity, but feeling that God had something better in store for him he never despaired the day of small things. He succeeded the Rev. J. C. Faulton at the First Baptist church. Finleyville. Pa. Rev. Saunders owes much of his success to his energetic wife who labored hard to help him. working out at day and hearing his lessons at night. being further advanced in some branches of common school. She sat up late with him. Rev Saunders is now pastor of the Bethlehem Baptist church, vice president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Pittsburgh and vicinity and secretary of the sare. having been three times elected as secretary.

    cardDetailedText: "In order to find out tho attitude of northern colleges toward negro students, Atlanta universfty (colored) sent a circular letter to several hundred institutions asking the names and addresses of students and graduates of negro descent and how they were regarded by the faculty and the student body. Many illuminating replies were received. Yale university answered that it never tried to attract negro students, but never felt justified In refusing admittance to those who came. At Leland Stanford there was said to be no hostility whatever toward colored students. Fordham university, New York, replied that it had never had negro applicants for admission, and if any should come it was impossible to say what reception they would ‘meet. At St. Vincent college, in Pennsylvania, it was said frankly that 'we do not think it wise under prevailing conditions to accept any distinctively colored students into the college.' Naturally none of the northern state universities draw the color line. In Missouri the line is sharply drawn. The president of Carleton college, in that state, writes: 'I have not found a student in the state who would tolerate a negro in the college, and it is even worse since the Johnson-Jeffries fight.' So It seems that while Mr. Johnson won the championship, he did not help the cause af negro education in Missouri. Nearly every year since 1826, when a negro was graduated from Bowdoin college, there’ have been colored graduates from the leading colleges of New England.—Boston Globe.    ",

    cardDetailedText: "‘NOT OPPOSING THE INTERCHURCH COLLEGE, BUT PREFER WORK WITHIN OUR CHURCH,' SAYS THE BISHOP. Nashville, Tena.—‘No, we are not opposing the Interchurch college, we are simply taking the position that all the work which is done by our church for the colored teachers and preachers should be done through the agencies of the church and not through any independent or allen instrumentality.' This is the statement made by Bishop E. E. Hoss in answer to a question as to whether or not the Methodist Episcopal church South, is opposing the American Interchurch college in its relation to social and religious training among the colored people. A called meeting of the executive board of education of the Methodist Episcopal church South, of which Bishop Hoss is a member, was held yesterday afternoon at the office of Dr. Percy  Maddin, also a member, and resolutions were adopted indorsing Paine college in Augusta, Ga., and the administration of the present officials was strongly commended. A communication from the board of missions was read in reference to the enlargement of the facilities for training colored preachers in Paine college and such additional facilities are thoroughly Approved by the executive committee. Similar action was taken by a special committee appointed for the purpose of determining the policy of the church in regard to the training of negro teachers and preachers. This special committee met yesterday also, the meeting being held at the publishing house and Paine college was indorsed unanimously. This committee consisted, of Bishop H. McCoy, Dr. J. D. Hammond, Senator John H. Sherard, Dr. John M. Moore and Mrs. MacDonald. Sitting with the committee by special invitation yesterday were Dr. E. B. Chappell of the Sunday school board and Mr. Stonewall Anderson, secretary of the board of education. One of the most Interesting features of the meeting was an account given by Senator Sherard of a visit to Mound Fayou, Miss., where the entire popuation is colored. The visit of Senator Sherard was greatly appreciated and a paper expressing this appreciation embodied the statement that there was an urgent need of sermons from the White ministers of the southern Methodist church. It was the sense of the committee expressed in a resolution offered by Doctor Moore, that the Methodist Episopal church, South, should operate through the Colored Methodist Episcopal church directly in all its efforts toward social and religious training of the negno. and in all other lines of work, but that the advantages offered by the church should also be open to the people of other colored churches, and especidlly to the Colored Methodist churches. This resolution was adopted. The committee also will recommend that the trustees of Paine college in Augusta, Ga. be respectfully asked to give consideration to the advisabiity of enlarging the department for the training of preachers at Paine college. and of establishing a correspondence school for colored preachers in the church. The following resolutions were adopted: 'In view of the need of enlarging the work of Paine college in several directions, it is recommended that we request the board of education to consider the matter of authorizing the president of Paine college to set about raising immediately an endowment for the college. Assured of raising funds for current expenses. It was also recommended that the board of missions give its hearty indorsement and pledge Its support to such a movement. 'Resolved, That the secretaries of the home department take steps looking to the holding of Sunday school institutes among the colored people. and that as a means to this end, the services of Doctor Chappell and his assistants be! secured in the enlistment of the general Sunday school board and of the conference Sunday school boards in this work.' The question of employing young women. and others, in training Sunday school teachers in the cities was discussed, and the following resolutions were adopted: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that specially equipped and well-trained persons be employed by the home department of the board of missions: to teach and train groups of colored Methodist Sunday school teachers In-our cities; and, 'Resolved. That this committee call attention to those pastors and city mission boards that employ deaconesses and other trained workers to the opportunity which they have in them to help in the development of the religious and moral life of the negroes. and to arrange for such use of them as shall lead to the accomplishment of this end.' The following resolution was also adopted: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that our home secretaries should use all legitimate means to arouse public sentiment among the white people in the communities where there is a large colored population in favor of proper housing and sanitation among the negroes, and that efforts should be made to enlist employers of negroes in towns, cities and country in reasonable plans for the social better ment of the negroes in their employ. The committee hereby expresses its sympathy with sane and well matured negroes who are making efforts to bring about through their leagues the educational, industrial and moral improvement of their people.” After discussing the question of training colored workers the following resolution was adopted: 'We beieve that Paine college should, be the educational center through which the Methodist Episcopal church, South, should at present undertake to prepare colored men and women for religious service. We respectfully recommend that the board of education and the board of missions and the trustees of Paine college consider the advisability at their next meeting of establishing a training school as a department of Paine college for the training and equipment of young women deaconesses, settlement workers, Sunday school teachers and for other religious work.'",

    title: "December 16, 1911",
    cardTitle: "Negro Labor Ignored",
    cardDetailedText: "The David Williams Company of New York City, publishes a weekly magazine entitled The Iron Age, devoted to the Iron and steel industries in the country. Under date of November 25 appears an article written and contributed by Mr. H. P. Bope, one of the leading steel men of our time, and a Pittsburgher. The subject of his article is 'Future Development of the Middle West.' He begins by taking the steel industry as an example. and applying his conclusions to all others. After showing the remarkable progress made in the steel industry and picturing a most optimistic view as to the future, Mr. Bope presents what he is pleased to call 'certain obstacles' which must be overcome, and 'certain dangers which are of tremendous importance.' These he classifies under three separate heads as follows: Legislative, Financial and Economic, the last of which he considers 'dangerous,' and discusses it at length under the head, 'Insufficient Supply of Common Labor.' The writer states that he has had more than thirty years of actual experience In the steel businéss, having worked himself up from the proverbial ground floor; hence the significance of his opinion. He states that when he first entered the steel business, the Irish were the one source of common labor, and he asserts that it was 'the best we ever had.' He explains that Irish labor grew scarce because they, 'recognising the opportunities of this country, sent their children to the public schools,' and the children, upon reaching maturity, belng fittied for higher positions in life, became foremen instead of common laborers as were thelr fathers. And the restilt is that common labor among the Irish is not as available as it was, and he adds, it never will be. 'The Irish. says Mr. Bope, were succeeded the Slav and Hun, but they were never equal to the increasing demand, nor was theirs the best labor, except under certain conditions.' Europe can no longer be depended upon to supply us with common labor. and there seems to be an inherent opposition to the use of the Japanese and the Chinese, since yellow and white do not mix. even in such a capacity. The conclusion of Mr. Bope is that the one great problem now facing the industrial world is that of common labor: and with whe supply of the Irish, the Stav, the the Hun, exhausted and the inhérent opposition to yellow labor so pronounced, he sees a perplexing situation ahead. That Mr. Bepe does not even consider the Negro labarer Is too apparent for comment. That he has no intention of considering him in the future is obvious from the picture he paints. He sees the passing of the Irish. the Slav, the Hun, and admits the impossibility of yellow labor. but, even in the last extremity, he neglects to consider the Negro either as a possible resolt in time of dire necessity, or as a future agency on which to depend when the Slav and the Hun, like their Irish predecessors, have educated their children 'for higher positions of life.' and have been promoted from the position of common labor to the more refined foremanship. The words of Mr. Bape have more than a common significance. His attitude as pictured in his article spells the elimination of the Negro from the industrial development of this country. That such is the policy of the industrial heads of today can not be denied in the face of the slleat rebuke of Mr. Bope. In the face of the past record of the Negro, we ask what has Mr. Bope or the industrial magnates to fear? Wé take pleasure in calling attention to the fact that the Negro has at all times when called upon, shown himself efficient and satisfactory. We have but to refer to the Homestead strike for sufficient proof of what the Negro will do when the white man does him the honor to employ him. From strike-breaking to the battlefield the Negro has labored in the interest of this country, and like Mr, Bope, we measure the future by the past to the extent of warranting the indus tries of the country that when they feel disposed to give the black man a chance, an equal chance, with the Irish, the Slav, the Hun or the European to show his efficiency as a laborer, he will not be found wanting. If the passing of the Irish, Slav and Hun means the creation of a necessity for Negro labor, we pray most ardently for such a consummation; believing as we do in the loyalty of the Negro to his country as well as in his natural fitness for American labor, with neither socialistic nor anarchistic tendencies. Unless Mr. Bope means to eliminate the Negro from the development of the Middle West, there need be no fear of 'insufficiency of common labor.'",

    cardDetailedText: " A recent issue of the Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser calls attention to a speech made by Gov. Emmet O'Neal before the conference of the A. M. E. church recently in session at Mont- gomery. Ala.  It is, interesting to use to note how these colored people in the south get on with leading officials. Seldom or never does one read of the governor of a northern state attending any of the conferences of our people, nor do we read of any of them offering words of advice which will help to encourage colored people to better liv- ing. As a rule, northern governors are never to be found around colored people except when they are seeking their votes. The report of this inci- dent in the far south, however, is so interesting that we are publishing it herewith fust as it appears in the Ad- vertiser: “The fourth day’s session of the A. M. E. conference, which Is in session at the Madison Avenue church, was a gala day for negro Methodists of the state. The principal feature of the day being an address by Gov. Emmet O'Neal, who had been invited to speak before the conference.  “At high noon all available space In the auditorium was filled by ne- groes who had turned out to do honor to the chief magistrate of Alabama. A committee headed by Rev. R. L. Pope, the pastor of the church, met the governor in front of the church and escorted him to the platform. Dr. W. H. Mixon of Selma, Ala., made the address in presenting him to Rt. Rev. H. B. Parks, the presiding bishop, who introduced the governor to the con- ference. A Chautauqua salute wa given, amid long applause. Governor O'Neal assured the conference of his sympathy for and interest in the ne gro ministry He said:  'No class counts for so much in the uplift and advancement of your; people as does the negro ministry. It is for the interest of the white man; as well as the black man to have the negro educated in the sciences and handicrafts of our civilization. To al- low the negro to remain among us ignorant and vile may prove to be a weight about our necks to drag us downs. While in New York some weeks ago, I was interviewed by the New York Journal. In answer to the question, was the negro’s uncontrolla- ble thirst for strong drink responsible for the failure of prohibition in the south, I said emphatically, no. I was born and reared among negroes and for twenty-fve years I practiced at the bar in Lauderdale county, yet I do not recall two negroes who were confirmed drunkards. i can never forget tbe loyalty of your race during the Civil war. History does not re- count another instance where a serv- ant race exhibited such loyalty to the master as has been exhibited by the American negro. I can never forget you. And so long as I occupy the governors chair I shall do all in my power to see that even-handed justice is meted out to every citizen of this commonwealth, be he rich or poor, black or white.’ Bishop Parks replied to the gov- ernor’s address. 'At the close of the reply a reso lution of thanks was offered the gov- ernor.' When strong men like Governor O'Neal are willing to speak out open- ly in praise of the loyalty of negroes and in determined assurance of his intention to mete out even-handed justice to blacks and whites alike they are entitled to our thanks. For one, The Age intends to give proper report to all.such incidents. It is the king of thing for which we publish this newspaper—New York Age. A New Orleans paper takes great pains to point out the desirability of giving the negro a square deal, and refers to many disabilities under which the negro labors in the south and nation. Some injustice may be expected under the circumstances. When it comes to the courts it is bet- ter that the negro stay out of them. The sooner the negro learns how to attend to his business and to avoid clashes with any and everybody the sooner he will learn the lesson which present unfavorable conditions are de- signed to teach. The point is not to be concerned too much about the privileges that are denied and to be concerned about the right use of those which are retained. —Durham (N. C.) Reformer. 'Have you ever thought of it—that great Son of Palestine was a carpen- ter’s son,' sald Dr. E. G. Hirsch of Chicago, in an address at Tuskegee Institute. 'He did not have a class- ical education, but he learned the les- son of life in his father’s carpenter shop; he did not go to academies, but he heard his divine father’s call. Whatever message he bad. be clothed it in the phraseology, not of the counting-room, and not of the draw ing-room, but into the impressive ,Vo- cabulary of the farmer and the ar- tisan. In practicing and learning to practice the religion of labor. you be come Christianized. in the spirit of the great teacher, and Judaized tn the spirit of the great Jewish prophets.' A number of industrious colored boys could find profitible employment after school bours and learn a valu- able trade if they could be induced to put in a few hours around either or both of the local colored printing  shops. There are too many colored boys wearing out valuable shoe leath-  er on Commerce street smoking cig arettes and going to the bad general- ly.—San Antonio Inquirer.   Spend your money with your race. They are struggling to build you up; so belp them.  There is no occasion for alarm on the part of the white people of this state because the negro population shows a slightly larger rate of in- crease. They still outnumber the colored people about eighteen to one, thus making the fear of “negro dom ination” groundless. The negroes, however, cannot view the increase of their number with as little concern, for the reason that it has come about very largely through migration from other states of a type of undesirablee, of men brought here to labor in the industrial centers, who too frequently mistake license for liberty. Coming as they mostly do from Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky where wages are lower, school terms are shorter and the at- titude of the whites toward them is more hostile than In this state, they are endangering the civil and political privileges not only of themselves, but of the entire race in West Virginia. This state of affairs has come about through the development of coal mining and the consequent demand for labor. In but few instances have the law-abiding, property-owning negroes of other states responded. Those who have heeded the call are, for the most part, the unattached, ignorant, happy-golucky element who are the best patrons of the saloonkeeper and form the reserve force from which the population of the penitentiary is recruited. This being the situation those negroes in the state who have any regard for their civil and political status must “view with alarm” this influx and hope that it will either be diverted or that those who come bere after may be of a higher type; otherwise, the movement for Jim Crow cars and disfranchisement will grow apace.—Charleston (S. C.) Advocate. The People’s Investment and Savings bank of Birmingham, Ala, Dr. W. L. Lauderdale, president, closed its doors, says the Birmingham American. In explanation of the trouble, Dr. Lauderdale has issued the following statement: 'By a special call of the board of directors of the People’s Investment and Savings bank by President W. L. Lauderdale, after a brief discussion pertaining to the affairs of the bank and Its best interest, since its robbery which disturbed the confidence of its depositors, the board did not deem It, wise, nor for the best interest of an parties concerned, to continue its present operations, and in view of this fact a resolution was passed calling on Hon. A. E. Walker, superintendent of banks of Alabama, to take the affairs of the bank in hand and liquidate its indebredness to secure the best interest of the depositors of the bank. 'The president and board further feel that In their judgment the bank has sufficient assets to pay its depositors in full.' Thomas L. Masson, editor of Life, recently delivered a lecture on 'Newspapers' before the students of the Glen Ridge (N. J.) high school. The speaker explained that there are three vocabularies in common use. These he classified as the ‘social vocabulary, literary vocabulary and the vocabulary of names or persons. The first, he said, is used in every-day 'chit chat,' and and the second in the schools, but the third, he declared, to be of the most importance. Well-read people, he declared, have an acquaintance almost personal with many personages they have never met. Three sources are open, Mr. Masson declared, from which this same vocabulary may be obtained. These are the daily newspaper, the weekly newspaper and the monthly reviews. The first, he asserted, are so hurriedly edited as to be often incorrect; the second, having more time, are usually more accurate, while the third class contains the substance of the news in the best forms.—South Life Magazine. Among the many race enterprises of Memphis we note the following: Thirty-five groceries and meat markets, 6 undertaker ehops, 3 cemeteries, 6 blacksmith and horseshoeing shops, 10 shoemakers, 4 harness and saddle makers, 2 old folks’ homes, 2 Infirmaries, 1 hospital, 2 newspapers and 2 church organs, 50 boarding houses and 12 restaurants, 4 drug stores, 2 banks, 60 barber shops, 40 pressing clubs, 7 printing plants, 1 shoe store, 1 gents' furnishing store, 1 photo studio, a park theater, 4 jewelry shops, 12 coal and wood compsnies, 1 supply house and 1 swimming pool. Memphis has also to her credit 12 lawyers, 30 physicians, 4 editors, 60 preachers, 110 school teachers, 80 carpenters and woodworkers, 120 brickmasons, 80 hodcarriers and mail carriers, 60 dressmakers and hairdressers; colored population, 52,000; real estate owned by them, $3,000,000. This is not in any sense a bad showing —Memphis News. No lady, colored or white, wants to force her way through a crowd of jostling men and boys such as is wont to congregate before negro paces of amusement rr worship. —Charleston (W. Va.) Advocate. A South Carolina negro, Lewis H. Wagner, having raised the amounts of money orders to bring about his imprisonment, wants to be sent to the federal prison in Atlanta, Ga., in order to perfect an invention, so he says, requiring the use of tools to be found in tbat place of incarceration. If this is true, it is indeed stranger than fiction. Jack Johnson was fined $100 in Newcastle, England, November 3 for overspeeding. His disregard for certain laws hasn't been rectified as yet. ",

Fairfax is pastor, was the occasion for a Jarge gathering of prominent citizens, educators and  professional men and women, srho are deeply interested in the work of the  organization. Besides the principal speaker of the evening, Dr. Joshua A. Brockett, Aladam Noble and George R.  Margetson took part in the splendid literary program rendered. The banquet orator was the Rev. J. Andrew Patterson of New York. the noted author. lecturer and psycho-physical culturist. Dr. Patterson has given years of study and research on subjects relating to health conditions among the colored people of the United States. He has also made careful investigations from time to time of the death rate among our people as to cause, age and kind of disease and the sanitary condition of residence, whether  city or country, in which large numbers of colored people live. Dr. Patterson's address was listened to with close attention. He said in part: 'The signing of the emancipation proclamation by the immortal Lincoln was a long stride toward the colored man’s freedom, but the sudden trausition from the forced simple life of slavery into the unknown complex conditions and responsibilities of freedom carried with it a calamity to the race more appalling to contemplate than the passing of the American Indian. The Indian of the border line of civilization needed to adopt but few of the vices and customs of modern civilization to exterminate him. 'On the other hand, the colored man is functioning right in the midst of a thousand rices, customs and conditions that will destroy any young race. And as a sincere student of this staggering question, being armed with irrefutable facts, I warn the colored people of America that unless something is done to stop this maddening dance of death before the twilight of another century falls the nations of the earth will have walled the dirge of another lost race. The real facts concerning the true moral and physical condition of the race relating to the increasing death rate are little understood by ministers and teachers. who bold the destiny of the race, as it were, in their hands. 'Not only is this generation innately inferior physically to the antebellum Negro. but for lack of knowledge the vast majority is not and cannot conserve its energy. In many sections Marriage is sadly waning. Among those who are married aversion to rearing familles is a scourge in itself that is blasting at the very foundation stone of the future race. 'Of every 100 colored children born: fifty die before the second birthday is reached. Is that all? No. Unmentioned thousands pass who never know an independent heart pulse. 'Insanity is rapidly increasing among Negroes under twenty-five, Consump- tion, or modern tuberculosis, ts becom- ing an epidemic almost as prevalent as the conventional bad cold. Already the young people under twenty-five are dying three to one white. 'There are those who will tell you that all is well,that there is no danger of the race dying off. I ask as one having authority, What will the future be? The speaker told of the wonderful work being done by the mind and  body culture movement and the new health culture which principals, if applies, would soon remedy the present condition of the race.

    cardSubtitle: "Migration and Colonization of the Chief Causes of Amalgamation of Primitive Races",
    cardDetailedText: "A great many modern writers and not a few who wrote in an earlier period are disposed in discredited the Aftrican  origin of the Egyptians, although their color, customs, and other physical characteristics clearly indicate that if any race of people on earth came out of the loins of Uam these did. Nothing seems to be more ceritain to those who have studied the question closely. Dr. Felis von Luschau professor of anthropology in the University of Berk, wrote an admirable paper before the first universal races congress, which met in London in 1911. approaches the subject with more candor und honesty that usually characterize the writings or the utterances of white men who have investigated this subject. While we know or have been told that all the Egyptians are not white or brown or of any of the intermediate colors between white and black, we also know from those who have traveled in that country that the majority of its Inhabitants are black and possess all the physical characteristics of the African. Cause of Distinct Color Varieties. The color of the Egyptian results therefore. from the admixture of the blood of neighboring races with the African blood of these indigenous blacks. Professor, von Luschau says: While the first varieties of primitive man were certainly formed and fixed by long isolation, later variations and races were caused by migration and colonization. as might perhaps best be showed by sketching the anthropology of Africa and the Pacific islands. Just as Madagascar was peopled about 900 or 1000 A.D. by Indonesian colonists coming from Sumatra, so untold ages ago the first inhabitants of Africa came from a place somewhere In southern Asia on the great line from Gibraltar in Australia. No skulls or skeletons of these earliest Africans are as yet known, but we may hope to find them sooner or later. as we already now know a good many sites of paleolithic implements in various parts of tropical and southern Africa. The anatomical , qualities of these first Africans will certainly be found to differ from those of aboriginal  Australians but in tens of hundreds of thousands of years the paleolithic African evolved into a real negro. He  exists in two varieties- a tall variety like the modern Nigerian from the coast of upper Guinea and a small  one    Third Race Makes Its Appearance But I have already stated that we are as yet quite ignorant of the real home of these small races. To these two oldest element in Africa was added  ages afterward, but still in prehistory times, a third one, the Hamitic It is descended from the same ancient Gibraltar Australia line. but was in a higher stage of civilization. These hamites had already a greatly refined language. With an admirable grammar closely related to that of the Samnite and Indo-Germanic languages In Egypt they created more th:u 6,000 years ago the marvelous civilization we now admire as the mother of our own. Ancient Hamitie influences can be traced all through African. In Abysinia, in Galia, Somali. and in Maasilayd  we find even now Hamitic languages or at least Hanitic grammar and Hamitic types. In central Africa. in the region of the great lakes, we have the Hima and Tusi, generally as chiefs reigning over Hantu tribes, often with face and figure like those of the old pharaohs of Egypt. Physical Features of Hamitic Type Even in South Africa nearly 1 percent of the actual Bantu population have high and narrow noses, thin lips and fine large orthographic skulls of the Hamitie type. and all the Hottentor languages and dialects have a pure Hamnitie grammar. Also the pastoral habits of many Africa tribes. their long horned cattle, spiral basket work. etc. are Hamitie. and all can thus trace hamitie influence from the Nile to the Cape of Good Hope. Still there are some Negroes and many, many white people in this country who profess to believe with a sort  of pitying contempt that the African is an unredeemable barbarian. Rev E B L Thompson of Sierra Leone  West Africa in his address before the Negro Society For Historical Research of Yonkers N. Y. on the  subject 'Race consciousness Race Ideal' said among other things: 'As the preponderance of the: inhabitants of Egypt today are of unmixed African blood, we may I think reasonably conclude that these people are of African origin. Otherwise how are we to account for their black faces, crisp hair and other typical Negro physical characteristics?'",

    cardSubtitle: " Memphis, the county seat of Shelby county, Tennessee, founded in 1826 and chartered as a city in 1849, called the Bluff City, 109 miles west of Nashville, is one of the chief commercial cities of the south and one of the moat important cotton markets in the United States. The growth of this city, both in population and commerce, has been remarkable. The population has grown from less than 9,000 in 1850, to 131,105 in. 1920. There are only five cities in the United States that have larger negro populations than Memphis. The last census shows negro population in six cities as follows: Washington, D. C., 94,446; New York, 91,702; New Orleans, 89,362; Baltimore, 84,749; Philadelphia, 84,459; Memphis, 52,441. There are in Shelby county, however, between 90,000 and 100,000: The new union depot which cost five million dollars, with equal accommodations for both races, the imposing sky-scrapers, the beautifully shaded and-paved streets, the costly residences, the 1,000 acres of lovely public parks, the junction of several great railroads, the trolley cars threading the avenues in every direction, the numerous factories, public buildings, costly and spacious churches, add to the, charm of this most wonderful southern city, situated on the great 'Father of Waters.' The spirit of progress is contagious. The colored people of this city have caught the spirit. Many of them have made good. They have been helped and encouraged by their white neighbors. This is very gratifying. As evidence of the material advancement, it is interesting to note that the value of the output of the various manufacturing establishments in Memphis has grown from a little more than one and a half million dollars in 1850 to over thirty million dollars in 1912, an increase of two thousand per cent. The negro’s best friends are found in the south. Here is an instance: In Judge Miller's court room the other day a negro youth was tried on the charge of theft. His employer, a well- known Dallas woman who is prominent in social circles, believed him, innocent. The evidence was entirely circumstantial. She saw that the boy had a good lawyer and she appeared as a witness in his behalf. The jury heard her story and promptly acquitted the negro, for the 12 men were fair-minded southerners who believe in giving the negro with a good record the benefit of the doubt. There is no blind prejudice against the black in the south. There is no race problem here, because the south is soft careless in its social relations. The, negro finds his real haven of refuge in Dixieland where he can always get a job, a square meal and a square deal. He knows the people are not his pretended friends when he tries to do right, and that they will fight for him when he is unjustly treated.—Dallas Times-Herald. Christian philosophy was designed from the beginning to keep the children of the woman and the sons of the man in their proper relation to one another in the home, the church and the state, so that the human race might be perpetuated, as the races be fore the Christian era were not. The thoughtful women of the negro race should study this matter. What the race needs are men, and it can't have them if the negro women their white sisters out of the home family making into the world of affairs where they must cease to be women and cannot be men.—New York Age. The ancient Guild of Spectacle Makers is numerically one of the strong; est of London companies. Its charter dates from the year 1629, and though the exact date of its origin is lost, there is ample evidence that the calling of spectacle maker was extensively followed at a very early date. An old book of 1563 mentions the spectacle makers among other traders, and the biography of Carl Zeno, an Industrious Venetian, who died in 1418, mentions that even at the age of eighty-four he needed no artificial aids to his sight. So presumably spectacles were common in Italy five centuries, ago. At Seattle Doctor Crichton has ordered the use of Puget sound sea water to lay the dust and flush the streets. 'Salt water is one of the best germicides in the world,' says Doctor Crichton. 'Sea water contains several grains of chloride of sodium to the gallon, and within a few days the city's streets will become white with sodium chloride and the action of the sun’s rays on this will produce chloride gas, one of the very best disinfectants known to science.' The Philadelphia Traction company has been experimenting with women conductors, in order to minimize the trouble it has with men and to reduce the cost of operating expenses’ of the experiment succeeds the men conductors will have to go. as the ticket sellers have gone, and the motormen will be in danger of losing their jobs. After a-woman has been a trolley. car conductor for a month who would have her for a wife? The ages of woman masculinity and rule have al- wars been the death ages of nian femininity and rule. Lieutenant Mortenol, a negro. who Is a native of Guadeloupe, has just been promoted captain in the French navy. There are several Chinese officers in the French army, but Captain Mortenol is the first negro to attain high rank in the navy. Some women are so changeable that they never wear the same complex- ion twice. No woman can afford to be a moment late if she expects to be called business-like. The average Chinaman knows how to keep silent when everybody else is talking. The average negro knows how to talk when everybody else is keeping silent. The two attitudes are not the same. The Chinaman learns, & great deal by keeping his mouth shut and the negro forgets a great deal by keeping his mouth open. ‘What a man learns and what a man forgets are not the same. Dr. Sun YatSen, who did so much to make the Chinese Republic possible, and was its provisional president, has been silent for months while the press of the world was trying to make it appear that the Chinese republic was on the verge of disruption because Dr. Sen and President Yuan Sbi-kai were at loggerheads over everything. Dr. Sen now breaks his silence in a Nankin interview to the New York Sun to declare that, personally, his relations with the president are cordial. and that their differences as to public policy and questions are only ‘such as exist between Statesmen in all countries who work together for the common welfare. He says: 'I believe I can safely say that upon one matter  of first importance all the leaders in’ China are of one mind: The beat good of the country. As to how this may be attained is quite another matter, but we are all striving and working for the meritorious and noble end.' No one thinks of a civil war in the United States simply because Mr. Taft, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Roosevelt do not-agree upon matters of public policy. Each of these gentlemen is certainly a true American and a patriot: of a very high order. Yet there are if my knowledge of American affairs  is worthy—many great and vital issues upon which they disagree totally. May it not be so in China?—New York Age. 'Negro Year Book'—whoever heard of such a thing? 'Annual Encyclopedia of the Negro'—whoever thought of devoting a whole volume of a year book and encyclopedia to any single race of people? Here it is, however, and it comes from Tuskegee. No one claims to have shown originality in thinking of it. It bears the name of Monroe N. Work, 'In charge of research and records.' Out of these records, at first only of the students and graduates of Tuskegee, and then of the negro population, this first of all rage books’ seems to have grown. Behind a desk of the Chicago Theological seminary 14 years ago & young negro student, Work by name, sat for three years. With plodding persistence he studied and struggled his way through to graduation. Ever loyal to his race, he eagerly learned all he could from them and the whites how to help them help themselves. He began at the beginning in looking about him here in Chicago, to find out what the actual-conditions of its people were. In the south he continued to look for facts on which to base the means and plans which Tuskegee and other schools for life and work were devising and carrying out. And now from his card catalogue of 'case records' and race facts comes this new and valuable attempt to register the progress of a race in this 'Negro Year book and Annual Encyclopedia.' Al- though it is but a beginning, it is creditable enough to him and his people to mark,an epoch in their history.—Tuskegee Student. A shy man will imitate the tactics of his older brother and wonder if that fellow meets with the same coolness. Five hundred Cuban negroes captured in the late uprising in the province of Oriente have been rounded up in the jails of Havana for safe keeping, as the other jails are already overcrowded. The Latin people like to play at revolution, and those who succeed fare sumptuously for a season, while those who fail, if captured, are very sure Sf having their heads cut off. If the Latin-American people should spend one-half the time in building up their governments that they do in striving to tear them down they would be a great and progressive people. For example, Mexico has lost in the past twelve months of internecine war what she had gained in thirty years of domestic peace. President Diaz ruled with a strong hand for a long period of years, but under him Mexico was prosperous at home and, had abundant credit abroad. If America’s annual candy supply were loaded on one train there could be over 8,000 trucks full of boxes. buckets and glass jars. This load of sweetmeats for the sweet tooth of the American girls costs the consumers about $125,000,000 every year. The woman's work is essentially in the home. The home is the foundation upon ‘which the Christian church and state are builded. Destroy the Christian home by unsexing woman in her work and manners as wife and mother and daughter, and the under- world, the wolves and swine of .the social order will rise up and sweep the Christian church and state from the map of the world. What then? The answer is to be found in the. death of Egypt, Rabylon, Carthage. Greece and Rome before the Christian era. Solomon thought he was de wisest man, but dey is folks in de world today who think dey could give him points in de wisdom game. an’ den, beat him at it With hearts as trumps any old gay deceiver can play a never ending game. Nobody thinks much of the widely advertised self-made man. Folly is what the other guys give themselves up to. ",

Presbyterian church. this city. Miss: Barr. who is assistant secretary of the board. said the first aim of the board is to give the Negro race a good moral foundation. They must therefore first be trained in the Bible and Christian living. 'The board is criticized sometimes,' she said. 'because it does not make Industrial education the first feature. It believes thoroughly in Industrial education and equips schools for the work as fully as possible.' She. described the farm of 1.000 acres at Keyesville. Ga., near Quensta. from which the board is parceling of to the Negroes farms of twenty or thirty acres each. giving to each a mule and a plow and building a small cottage. The tenant is allowed to pay for this equipment and the land by rental fees. so that in time the property becomes his own. 'The, colored people of the United States now own farms' said Miss Barr, 'of such extent as would include all the New England states.' By this statement she referred to negro ownership generally, not ab ue to that fostered by the Presbyterian hoard. This board operates 151 schools. all of them being taught entirely by Negroes except six. The board emphasizes the need of an entirely Negro ministry and supports in part 290 Negro ministers. There are 15,000 children in the board’s schools, and in each one the Bible is a daily textbook. Mrs. M. J. Gildersleeve of New York city's secretary of the woman’s board of home missions, at a study class during the meeting pointed our the wide culture which may accrue from mission study. 'It is a university education' she said. At another time she pointed out the common tie between all the varied peoples of the United States—Alaskans. mountaineers, Negroes, Mexicans and Indians speaking also of the Cubans and Porto Ricans, to whom the board ministers. She said the building of railroads and the development of resources are greatly increasing the missionary’s opportunity. Mrs. S.

    cardDetailedText: "KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 80 — ‘the Migratory Movement has cost the state of Georgia more than $2,000,000 in a single year!  The ‘migratory movement has cost the south a decrease of almost 500,000-people in population The migratory movement  has caused federal authorities to investigate more into the stories of peonage and to use  a federal law to abolish lynching and the use of the mask. But more potent, more: powerful and more dreadful (to the white south) is the realization that with the departure of the Negro goes the political power of the South. Speaking on this phase of the question, an entirely new angle is given it by Cole Blease, one-time Governor of South Carolina. South's Power Doomed 'The Night of the Solid South is a Fading Glory.' Standing before an audience of five thousand white and colored citizens of Columbia, S. C.. Cole Blease, one-time Governor of the State, at a conference for the discussion of inter-racial relations, threw a bomb shell into the calm contentment of the whites by telling them that the scepter of political power was about to depart from Judah. Taking the question up in detail, he told them how they had enjoyed representation in the lower house of Congress upon the basis of population. In a state where the two races were nearly equal in number, like his own, the whites had all. the representatives, though the blacks furnished half of the population of which they were apportioned. With migration going on, and thousands and tens of thousands leaving, the 1930 census will find an entire shift of population, the South having less and the North having more people. The result will be less Southern Congressmen and more Northern, Cole Blease, in all his terms of office, made nationally famous by his spectacular acts, such as the release of many hundreds of prisoners from the state penal institutions, never made such a sensation as this speech. Secure for half a century in political power, regardless of shifts of opinion elsewhere in the country, Southern democracy has wrapped its mantle of power about it and stood to be catered to. Its certainty of continued victory has made it the Leader of even the National Democratic party. It has imposed its will upon the National party through its unity in caucus, And now, as related by Cole Blease, the boll weevil and the migration of the Negro have stripped off the robe and shown it to be just a big imposing shell, covered over with pretense and supported on the skeleton legs of shifting population. 'It was a sober. meeting when he had concluded. The Negroes realizing that citizen rights and even human rights were furthest from the thoughts of the leaders of their states, could see no end to the march northward. The whites, seeing the end of the benighted ignorance of Negroes about conditions elsewhere than in the place of their birth, knew no concessions now, not even actual equality before the law, would stop the stampede, and realized that at last their political system had been weighed in the balance and found wanting, and that even now the enemies forces were thundering at the gates of their moth-eaten aristocracy. 'You may think what you please, you may do what you please, ’concluded. Blease, 'the day of the political South is almost done!'",

    cardDetailedText: "(Pittsburgh Courier Service Special) Wilmington, North Carolina, has set a most wholesome example for the whole South by her recent adoption of a program of. indictment to take the place of the usual program of force to keep the Negro South. The whole state is in sympathy with the new idea, and the best whites and blacks have agreed that migration can be stopped by the South itself, if the two races but agree that the migration is the cause of improper treatment toward. the migrants. Indeed, North Carolina is the one southern state where the races live under a workable understanding.  Lawlessness, crime, mobs, and oppression are less frequent and less general in North Carolina than in any other southern state. As apart of the program of inducement  rather than force, the races at Wilmington have agreed that common justice, a square deal, and a living opportunity shall  be given the Negro who loves law, order and progress. There are a few leading white men in Wilmington who are, not afraid to, accord the negro a fair chance. The response of the Negroes was instant and most sincere. Whole Sea Beach Provided One of the mast convincing pieces of evidence of good faith was the opening of Shell Island Beach, just cut of Wilmington. This is the coming Atlantic City of the South. The Island boasts of 12 cottages, a pavilion seating 5,000, with hotel accommodations on the third floor. It has a beach front of two miles. A hotel proper is in contemplation. The island is ruled by.Negro officers who have been given an opportunity to show themselves friends of law and order among their own people. This is considered an excellent beginning of the education of law, enforcement. This ought to breed a deeper. respect for law and organized government. The beach was officially opened May 30, with Dr. R. R. Spiller as principal speaker. The promoters include such men of both races as the following: C. B. Parmlee, Thos. H. Wright, J. Allen Taylor, W. H. Spront and Robert Norfolk. These are the leading white forces co-operating with such colored citizens as: Frank Avant, Dallas Chesnut, Foster Burnett, all physicians; Thomas Hooper, Rev. G. D. Carnes, A. J. Wilson, Dr. W. H. Moore, one of the leading ministers and John E. Taylor. Mr. Taylor has a state wide reputation for helping every real race movement. These forces have decided to make Wilmington a place to be sought rather than shunned. The slogan is Wilmington, and the ambition of the people is to make the town the leading resort on the southern shores. With such a working force as described above, there is no fear that Wilmington will lose her Negro population because of oppression, lawlessness or mob violence.The names of the men stand for too much in the South to permit even the suspicion that Negroes will be forced out of North Carolina because of oppression. Already, the Wilmington program is being studied by other cities in the South, and steps are ander contemplation to bring together in every large city and  community the best thought and judgment of the two races for the protection of southern liberty and southern industries. North Carolina has set the pace. Others are certain to follow. Inducement and not force, will keep the Negroes South, and laws will not be needed to keen labor agents away.",

    cardSubtitle: "Liberia Today A third Party Congradulations - Negro Education",
    cardDetailedText: "Two distinguished Americans of color have recently returned from Liberia, West Africa, and both are emphatic in their assertions that the black re- public is making rapid progress. Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, editor of The- Crisis, who represented President Coolidge with the rank of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotiant at the inauguration of President Charles D. B. King for his second term, says of his observations there: I spent one month In Liberia, a week in Sierra Leone and 10 days in Senegal. I visited Portugal and Moorish Spain and am tremendously impressed with the beauty of Africa and especially of Liberia and its future opportunities. Mrs. Helen Curtis of Brooklyn, N. Y. was specially invited by President King and his wife to be present at the inauguration on January 7. Upon her return to this country she gave out a statement, a part of which follows:  I had not visited Liberia since my husband's term of office as United States Minister and Consul General, which had been cut short by his death in 1917, Having passed through the thrilling experiences consequent upon the war period In Monrovia, I was particularly anxious to return and see what progress the country had made. There were signs of advancement on every side, and the Inauguration week gave a fine opportunity to see the place Liberia held, not only as an independent black republic but internationally. There were no roads when I was here and no automobiles, Now it is a common thing to have a couple of hours ride on the road recently constructed.  which is only the beginning of a road program which is being carried out. The native chlofe have heartily entered Into co-operation with the government, and in one section built nearly one hundred miles of road upon their own initiative The who legislature, which has Just adjourned, has passed some of the most beneficial enactments of recent years, among them, new debt laws, a law on mineral development and another giving freer access to the interior trade. From these reports by eye-witnesses who have no axes to grind, we feel safe in saying that Liberia may yet take her rightful place in the vanguard of progressive nations. She may yet vindicate the faith of those who nearly a hundred years ago made a  practical move toward giving the Negro a chance to  demonstrate his latent and potential capacity for self-government. WITH the slogan, 'the hope of the farmers and industrial workers,' a call has been issued by the Farmer-Luborites for a third party  convention at St. Paul on June 17. Senator Robert Marion LaFollette  is expected to lead the new group should they decide to buck the old line politicians and go before the country independently. In the last senatorial elections avowed progressives and radicals won in the states of Wisconsin, Minne- sota, Montana, North Dakota, Washington, Iowa and Nebraska. A progressive governor won in Colorado. Some of these men ran as Republicans, and some as Democrats—merely a matter of convenience. In the progressive bloc in Congress Democrats and Republicans alike have co-operated with the Farmer-Labor senators in almost total disregard of party ties. Around this nucleus centers the attempt to build a national third party. It will be seen that this discontent is largely In the West and Northwest. The farmers are dissatisfied But it is hardly to be suspected that a half dozen states can turn the tables on institutions of a half century and more standing. Relief in some way will be found for the farmers. President Coolidge has said as much. To rush matters might cause unnecessary delay. It takes no straining of the imagination to foresee a change of sentiment within the next few months. The voters of the West and Northwest will realize be- fore November that their special grievances are not the whole show. Then they will line up with other patient citizens and give Coolidge a chance to put his program through, They will realize that individual corruption is not so widespread as has been intimated, and that even though certain Republicans have been guilty of misconduct, there are Republicans remaining who will see that they are ferreted out and punished. They will also recall that through the storm of recrimination which we have just passed, the only cool man in Washington was the head of the Republican party. Even the progressives went off half-cocked. These facts will cause much serious thinking be- fore any third party gets popular recognition. And once these facts are thought over, a third party will be still farther from a national foot-hold in American political life. CONGRATULATIONS are in order for Miss Jessie Redmon Fauset, literary editor of The Crisis, on the completion and acceptance for publication of her novel, 'There Is Confusion.' It will appear this spring bearing the Boni and Liveright trade-mark, one of the most outstanding publishing houses in New York, The story, as announced, is a study of the Negro in the North-'the better class.' At a dinner at the Civie Club, a fashionable and famous hostelry in the downtown section of New York, notables, writers and literary folk, both white and colored, expressed appreciation and encouragement on Miss Fruset's undertaking. Carl Von Doren, literary editor of the Century Magazine, and Horace B. Liveright,  of the firm that accepted the work, both spoke encouragingly and urged greater literary effort among our group. Mr. Liveright, who also published Jean Toomer’s fantastic and extraordinary 'Cane,' brought the depressing news that 'Cane' did not take so well with the public. But, he said, he stood .ready to take another chance with any promising and worthy literary aspirant. We do not as yet know what the merits of Miss Fauset’s novel are, but she is correctly praised for making the effort that has proved successful thus far. The Writers’ Guild, an organization of the younger writers, sponsored the occasion at the suggestion of Mr. Charles S. Johnson. FRANKLIN FRAZIER, director of the School o of Saeial Work at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Ga, in a recent vigorous article on Negro education in Opportunity, says: Today Negro education faces a crisis. This crisis is not so much due to the parsing of missionary  and philanthropic support. It is a spiritual rather than an economic crisis. old ideals are inadequate. Missionary education  might have prepared the Negro to live in heaven. but it d1d not fit him for the culture complex In which he finds himself. But the old education in its day did give the Negro an objective.  Negro education offers no objective to the Negro today. Old ideals have been dissipated.  The Negro is either revolting against the old ideals or is adopting a narrow and selfish  individualism. Hence the large number of students who are preparing themselves for the professions as a means to wealth and enjoyment,  and not as a means for deeper and more responsible participation in our civilization. This is a clear cut statement of a question not easily faced. The deeper we delve into it, the less we know how to answer, But what the writer says is true, and we must eventually develop some kind of a solution. 'The old ideals are inadequate.' The Negro no longer has his being purely for the motive of going to heaven when he dies. He wants something more. He wants something here on this earth, in this life— more than mere material assets.",

    cardSubtitle: "Robert Williams, a co-worker in Africa, almost forty years ago, with Cecil Rhodes, and directly in touch ever since with d developments there, read an interesting paper recently before the Royal Colonial Institute in London, describing his observations and experiences in an extensive continental tour last year. Mr. Williams said: 'Since 1911, when I last went through Africa, the black man has been rapidly rising above his former status of a mere laborer, but he may have a long furrow to plough before he arrives  at the stage of self-government. The Sudan is now full of promise and destined to play an important role in the future of Africa and the whole world. The desert begins to give place to rich vegetation, and enormous tracts of fertile land are adapted to cotton, sugar, tobacco and other crops, while tens of thousands of square miles in the highlands are fit for cattle ranching. More than 200,000 acres are now under cotton cultivation and irrigation will bring in some further 3,000,000 acres, a production of 1,000,000 bales annually within fifteen years, a fact of the utmost importance to Europe. Were it not for the sections of the Cape to Cairo Railway, already built, running from paying their way from Cape Town to Bukama on the Congo, 2,600 miles, it would be impossible to operate the great diamond, gold and copper industries of South and Central Africa. In many spheres of work, the black man is edging out and displacing White labor. The lower standard of living of the native enables him to undercut the white man wherever their labor comes into competition. The white would starve on a wage which is wealth to the black man. Is the native to be held down forcibly from engaging in work which lies within his ability, or is he to be kept from rising tb the full height of his power; or is the black worker to be paid on the same scale as the white on the principal of equal pay for. equal work, which would simply mean that all mines would shut down? They would not work.'",

Such is the meaning of 'From Dixie to Broadway.' It took years to come up from the cotton fields of the South to be acclaimed as an artist—something above vaudeville and ragtime. THE ASSOCIATED NEGRO PRESS is writing a series of articles on Negro cities. These are not corporate cities, but literal. They are cities within cities, with no physical line of demarcation, but easily found by the observing sociologist. In Philadelphia, Chicago, Pittsburgh, New York you can easily find 'colored town.' These cities are growing, not necessarily in size, but in character and community interest. They are proving they are not a liability to the town as a whole. May they grow and grow. A NEWS story in-a New York paper reports: Thomas Jefferson Scott, eighteen-year-old son f Captain Charles Harrington Scott, who formerly  lived in Montgomery, Ala., but who now makes his home at 63 Washington square, South, was taken to Welfare Island yesterday to begin an indeterminate sentence imposed by Judge Alfred Talley in General Sessions, following his conviction on charges made by Frances Whalen, nineteen, of 570 Walton avenue, the Bronx. Captain Scott served in the army during the World War, and is said to 'have made considerable money in the turpentine business in the South. His sister is prominent  in Boston society and was one of the founders of the Southern Society in that city. Judge Talley gave the youth a sentence which may run for as long as three years, after many prominent New York men had written him asking that he bear in mind Scott's youth-and the prominent position of his father in Alabama in considering the case. This young man might have gotten his start in this direction in Alabama by preying on helpless colored girls. Or he might have heard others near him boast of their accomplishments, Southerners will yet learn that what is a crime against one girl is a crime against any. THE MOUTHPIECE, 'official organ of the Harlem Economic Association,' has an interesting Christ- mas number. When studied thoughtfully it makes New Yorkers sad. It makes then realize how far they are behind the times in a business and commercial way. Think of Chicago with two banks, several insurance companies and scores of other racial enterprises, while New York has not a single Negro bank and few other legitimate-businesses to make one proud, There is quite a contrast between East and West. GEN. CALLES, the new president of Mexico, says he would like to give Mexicans training similar to that received by Negroes at Tuskegee and Hampton. The Mexicans need it. The great mass of their people are not much further in civilized life than the Southern backwoods Negro. But the tribute to the genius of Booker Washington and General Armstrong is the essence of General Callos remark, Those men discovered ‘the kind of training any backward people needs in this day and time.

    cardDetailedText: "Organizations Protest Deportation of Porto Ricans in Southwest By GEORGE PERRY. . Sept. 9.— (By Coast News Bureau).—The situation in the cotton producers of the Southwest has the political point of choosing between using Black American or the less efficient Mexican from our sister Republic. a bumper crop in Texas, Mexico, Arizona and California, if harvest hands be secured. The Chinese, Japanese and Hindus heretofore the source of labor supply, have been driven away through the strict enforcement of the anti-alien land law. The Mexican is unavailable in sufficient quantities due to the United States immigration laws, The influx of Black American labor is undesired for fear of attracting a parasite class of migratory labor whose permanent abode will be undesirable,  Free from Oriental domination,  yet unable to recruit sufficient  white farm hands to make up the deficiency, the farmers find themselves faced with a problem more serious than ever. Seeking Several Solutions. A solution in the Mexican situation  is being sought through an attempt  to set aside the present immigration  restrictions for the purpose  of allowing contract Mexican labor to be imported across the border under the condition that they are to be returned after the harvest. A bill to this extent will be introduced  in the next California legislature. Protest Porto Rican Entry Another solution is the attempt of the American Cotton Growers Association to import 1,500 Porto Ricans and their families into the Salt River Valley district near Phoenix, where there exists a shortage  of 2,900 cotton pickers. Claiming  that the Porto Ricans being classed as American citizens are not barred by Federal immigration  restrictions, a shipload of Porto  Ricans are being brought in by the  Association. They are expected to  arrive at Galveston within a short time. Labor Organizations Protest. The labor organizations of the Southwest have filed in Washington, a complaint against their intention, claiming that their use in the  Southwest cotton fields will lower the wage-scale to the point where American labor could not compete. This same objection has applied to the use of the Chinese, Japanese and Mexican together with the fact that they are unassimilable, and retard the commercial, industrial and  educational growth of the respective communities by holding back  improvements of all kinds, as well as withholding their money from general circulation. Black Americans Solution. The bankers, railroads, merchants, and moneyed interests are gradually  reaching a consensus of opinion that the only real solution to the problem is to populate the various communities in the cotton districts with a thrifty selected class of  producing Black American farmers. The Black American of all the laboring classes available in  sufficient numbers is the only class that measures up to the Southwest's  requirements. The only objection to him is that he is Black. Nevertheless  Black Americans are assailable  to Americanism and the white man’s standard of living. They maintain the same standard of morals  and living as conducive to the highest type of American civilization. As shown by the 100.000 or more who now reside in this Southwest  territory, the Black American maintains highly organized bodies of Christian worshipers, he has hundreds of good, modern comfortable  homes, his household is maintained  on an independent and self-respecting basis; he is engaged in business; his money is constantly in circulation; and as a wage earner he is to be found in thousands of homes, factories, banks and business establishments, occupying positions of respect and trust without detriment  to the prevailing local standard of labor conditions and wages.",

    cardTitle: "National Negro Health week",
    cardSubtitle: "",
    cardDetailedText: "'The time has come when the health of the colored man should not. be looked upon as a question for the Negro but as a problem for both races.' In these words Major R. R. Moton accurately expressed the attitude of intelligent people toward the health of the Negro at a recent conference in Washington D. C. While much more can be done by the Negroes themselves than has been done by them, it is by no means a strictly Negro problem. Indeed, white people are more responsible than Negroes for the present high death and sickness rates of the Aframerican population. It is because of industrial discrimination that relegates black people to the lowest paid ranks of labor. and housing segregation with its consequent disease breeding, that the black population suffers from a death rate twice as high as that of the whites. Color phobia of the white population renders it difficult for the Negro to extricate himself from this dilemma. Disease does not discriminate. It is encouraging and laudable, of course, to find prominent Negro educators, physicians, and insurance officials attempting to relieve the situation. It is quite time that the problem attracted their attention. Very little, of course, is accomplished  by setting aside special weeks for everything from babies to bananas, save to focus attention of the group and the nation on the fact that such things are of importance. That good health is important hardly needs to be stressed. However, the National Negro Health Week will do no harm and may do some  good. We hope it will. Such work. however, should be going on the entire year. There is no reason why every Negro community should not have a clinic with a paid staff to carry on educational and  preventative work. Any Negro community that can afford a church should have a clinic. Every person should know as much about his body as he does about the streets in his  neighborhood. An intensive educational campaign in every  community under local auspices would do much to free Negroes from the great economic losses due to illness and death, and liberate the masses from their present abject slavery to  useless, if not injurious, quack medicines. This work requires and should have the support and  cooperation of the white people in every community, and the most effective argument to use in gaining their support is the  economic one. For instance, it can be easily shown by the most casual Negro investigator that the whites themselves lose money because of the deplorable health of the black citizens,and the conditions that give rise to this situation. Social psychologists tell us that the intelligence of a crowd is that of its most ignorant member. The same is true with the prosperity of a community: its health is that of its least healthy group. Ten thousand Negro workers working 2,600,000 days per annum at an average salary of 84 a day. have a total  consumptive power equal to £10,400.000, That is to say that these workers can consume food. clothing. shelter and amusements worth that much. If a thousand of these workers are  incapacitated through sickness for a per capita average of twenty days a year. the consumptive power of the Negro community has been reduced by £80,000. Every death of an able bodied worker means a loss to the community of over a thousand  dollars on the basis of a 260-day year at £4 a day. Again, assuming that the total income of our hypothetical community is ten million dollars per annum on a basis of ten thon=and workers and a total population of fifteen thousand, and that the death rate is 20 per 1.000 per annum, the total number of deaths will be 300. If each funeral, including the doctor's bill, costs $300. the total loss in consumptive power (from the viewpoint of local merchants) will be £150,000.  Considering the fact that the Negro death rate is usually twice that of the white death rate. then the total loss in consumptive power to the community, over and above the normal loss, will be $75,000. For a community of 150,000 Negroes the loss will be $750,000. Thus in cities like Baltimore, New York, Washington Memphis, New Orleans, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Louisville, Atlanta, Birmingham, Norfolk, and Jacksonville, it can be plainly seen that the community loses a fortune through bad health of the Negro population. For the country at large the total loss in dollars and cents is tremendous. And mind you, all this has nothing to do with the loss in productive power of the community. Verily, good health pays. Looked at from another angle, a Negro ghetto where deplorable health  conditions exist and the death and sickness rates are twice or thrice as great as among the white population, constitutes a great menace to the whites. Germs are democratic—they know no color line. They assail white and black alike. A germ will fly from a sick Negro to a healthy white man with admirable and un-American impartiality. The relations between the two races are close, both before and after sunset. It is quite logical to assume, therefore, that the white death rate might mot be so high in some localities if it were not for the unusually high rates in the black ghettos.  These are the sort of arguments for Negroes to use in seeking to gain the support and co-operation of the white  people with money and authority in various communities. Talk in dollars and cents and you will get immediate attention and, assistance. Only threats against pocketbooks and lives is  instantly heeded. No person wants to lose either. The white merchants who are deaf to appeals in the name of Jesus Christ will incline their ears readily enough when it is pointed out that their attitude is costing them a half million dollars or so every year that might otherwise be spent over their counters. Nor will they remain impassive when the close relation between bad housing and health and a big tax rate is indicated. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and $10,000 spent for health education through lectures, clinics and sanitary  inspection may save a community $100,000. Such constructive propaganda can be freely broadcast by Negroes in every community (even the worst towns) without fear of reprisal. It will help both whites and blacks. It will create understanding and not antagonism. It will be fundamental and not palliative or futile. Problems are solved by  going to their roots. If those interested in bettering the health; of the Negro population will bring home to the rest of America just how much is lost in cold cash by the present conditions, we shall doubtless bring our death and sickness rates down to at least the level of the white population in the next five years.",

    cardDetailedText: "The great soft coal strike is on. Over 200,000 organized miners in the Central Competitive Field of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Western Pennsylvania have dropped their tools and left their accustomed places in the bowels of the earth. It promises to be a rather long struggle and whichever side wins, the result is likely to be somewhat disastrous in that it will destroy much of the business, of the operators and, may  seriously cripple the miners’ organization. Yet there was no other alternative. Flushed with profits, the operators have decided to crush the workers' organization for all time by their well known methods, viz., the open shop, hired gunmen,  injunction-serving judges and starvation. The miners’ union could do nothing less than to fight bitterly for the standard of wages and conditions of work so laboriously attained throughout the years. In this great struggle black and white union miners are marching side by side. Ju ‘ As in the great steel strike of 1919, the dominant factor in this struggle is the recently arrived Negro migrant who  constitutes the backbone of the industry in the non-union soft coal fields. Thousands of them have been brought into the great soft coal fields of West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, herded into company houses, handed out company paternalism and paid from two to three dollars less per day than union men. For some years there has been a struggle on the surface  between the operators in the Southern and the Northern fields. Under the surface, however, there was no struggle at all, since through interlocking. directorates the larger companies in both fields are controlled by the same people. Great efforts have been made by the operators to develop the Southern field  because it is non-union and because there is a ready supply there of black and white workers, ignorant of their best interests and how to protect them. The United States Bureau of Mines  estimates that from 25 per cent of the nation’s output of soft coal, the production in the non-union Southern field has leaped to over 65 per cent. Thus the Southern field grows in importance while the Northern field declines, yet it is the Northern field and its militant, organized miners with their higher wages and better working conditions that sets the standard for the Southern. If the union miner did not get six dollars a day, the non- union miner would not get four, so on all along the scales of wages and conditions of work. As the situation stands today, the black worker can make or break either the operators or the miners’ union. The future of the soft coal industry rests in the hands of the Negro. With the cessation of work in the Northern field, production will naturally increase in the Southern field. From 65 per cent of the total soft coal output, the production in this field may  increase easily to 80 or 90 per cent. This means that if the underpaid non-union Negro workers in the West  Virginia-Kentucky-Tennessee field, along with their “scabbing” white  fellow workers, do not make common cause with the organized black and white workers to the North, the unions are doomed to defeat. And let it not be forgotten that in defeating the unions, the non-union miners are delivering themselves a body blow since their scale of wages is based on that of the organized men. One of the tragedies of this conflicts the fact that its significance is practically lost to the average so-called educated Negro in the Southern coal field. Or when its significance is realized, this Negro, by and large, is too mendacious or cowardly to give the obviously proper advice. Those that are not owned body and soul by the operators, remain silent for economic reason. Here is a momentous struggle in which organized  laborers are fighting grimly for decent wages, and proper  protection on the job—both black and white unionists, if you please. A victory for the union means increased membership, greater prestige, and a nearer approach to the American  standard of living for all miners. A victory for the operators means an extension of industrial feudalism, the further spread of the open shop, the lowering of wages and the general decline of living standards. The black miners in the non-union field will decide the issue.",
