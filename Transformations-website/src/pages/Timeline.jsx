    cardTitle: "The “Pittsburgh Proclamation.”",
    cardSubtitle: "Adopted by the Founding Congress of the American Federation of the International Working People’s Association",
    cardDetailedText:"Comrades! In the Declaration of Independence of the United States we read: When a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Has the moment not arrived to heed the advice of Thomas Jefferson, the true founder of the American Republic? Has government not become oppression? And is our government anything but a conspiracy of the ruling classes against the people — against you? Comrades! Hear what he have to say. Read our manifesto, written in your interest and for the welfare of your wives and children and toward the good of humanity and progress. Our present society is founded upon the exploitation of the propertyless class by the propertied. This exploitation is such that the propertied (capitalists) but the working force body and soul of the propertyless, for the price of the mere cost of existence (wages) and take for themselves, i.e., steal the amount of new values (products) which exceeds the price, whereby wagesare made to represent the necessities instead of the earnings of the wage-laborer. As the non-possessing classes are forced by their poverty to offer for sale to the propertied their working forces, and as our present production on a grandscale enforces technical development with immense rapidity, so that by the application of an always decreasing number of human working force, an always increasing amount of products is created; so does the supply of working force increase constantly, while the demand therefor decreases. This is the reason why the workers compete more and more intensely in selling themselves, causing their wages to sink, or at least on the average, never raising them above the margin necessary for keeping intact their working ability. Whilst by this process the property less are entirely debarred from entering the ranks of the propertied, even by the most strenuous exertions, the propertied, by means of the ever-increasing plundering of the working class, are becoming richer day by day, without in any way being themselves productive. If now and then one of the propertyless class become rich it is not by their own labor but from opportunities which they have to speculate upon, and absorb the labor-product of others. With the accumulation of individual wealth, the greed and power of the propertied grows. They use all the means for competing among themselves for the robbery of the people. In this struggle generally the less-propertied (middle class) are overcome, while the great capitalists, par excellence, swell their wealth enormously, concentrate entire branches of production as well as trade and intercommunication into their hands and develop into monopolists. The increase of products, accompanied by simultaneous decrease of the average income of the working mass of the people, leads to so-called “business” and “commercial” crises, when the misery of the wage-workers is forced to the extreme. For illustration: the last census of the United States shows that after deducting the cost of raw material, interest, rents, risks, etc., the propertied class have absorbed — i.e., stolen — more than five-eighths of all products, leaving scarcely three-eighths to the producers. The propertied class, being scarcely one-tenth of our population, ...in spite of their luxury and extravagance are unable to consume their enormous “profits,” and the producers, unable to consume morethan they receive — three-eighths — so-called “over-productions” must necessarily take place. The terrible results of panics are well known. The increasing eradication of working forces from the productive process annually increases the percentage of the propertyless population, which becomes pauperized and is driven to “crime,” vagabond-age, prostitution, suicide, starvation, and general depravity. This system is unjust, insane, and murderous. It is therefore necessary to totally destroy it with and by all means, and with the greatest energy on the party of everyone who suffers by it, and who does not wantto be made culpable for its continued existence by his inactivity. Agitation for the purpose of organization; organization for the purpose of rebellion. In these few wordsthe ways are marked which the workers must take if they want to be rid of their chains; as the economic condition is the same in all countries of so-called “civi-lization”; as the governments of all Monarchies and Republics work hand in hand for the purpose of opposing all movements of the thinking part of the workers; as finally the victory in the decisive combat of the proletarians against their oppressors can only be gained by the simultaneous struggle along the whole line ofthe bourgeois (capitalistic) society, so therefore the international fraternity of people as expressed in the International Working People’s Association presents itself a self-evident necessity. True order should take its place. This can only be achieved when all the implements of labor, the soil and other premises of production, in short, capital produced by labor, is changed into societary property. Only by this presupposition is destroyed every possibility of the future spoilation of man by man. Only by common, undivided capital can all be enabled to enjoy in their fullness the fruits of the common toil. Only by the impossibility of accumulating individual (pri-vate) capital can everyone be compelled to work who makes a demand to live. This order of things allows production to regulate itself according to the demand of the whole people, so that nobody need work more than a few hours a day, and that all nevertheless can satisfy their needs. Hereby time and opportunity are given for opening to the people the way to the highest possible civilization; the privileges of higher intelligence fall with the privileges of wealth and birth. To the achievement of sucha system the political organizations of the capitalistic classes — be they Monarchies or Republics — form the barriers. These political structures (States), whichare completely in the hands of the propertied, have no other purpose than the upholding of the present disorder of exploitation. All laws are directed against the working people.Insofar as the opposite appears to be the case, theyserve on the one hand to blind the worker, while onthe other hand they are simply evaded. Even the schoolserves only the purpose of furnishing the offspring ofthe wealthy with those qualities necessary to upholdtheir class domination. The children of the poor getscarcely a formal elementary training, and this, too, ismainly directed to such branches as tend to produc-ing prejudices, arrogance, and servility; in short, wantof sense. The Church finally seeks to make completeidiots out of the mass and to make them forego theparadise on earth by promising a fictitious heaven. Thecapitalistic press, on the other hand, takes care of theconfusion of spirits in public life. All these institutions,far from aiding in the education of the masses, havefor their object the keeping in ignorance of the people.They are all in the pay and under the direct control ofthe capitalistic classes. The workers can therefore ex-pect no help from any capitalistic party in their struggleagainst the existing system. They must achieve theirliberation by their own efforts. As in former times aAmerican Federation of the IWPA: “Pittsburgh Proclamation” [Oct. 1883] 3privileged class never surrendered its tyranny, neithercan it be expected that the capitalists of this age willgive up their rulership without being forced to do it.If there ever could have been any question onthis point it should long ago have been dispelled bythe brutalities of the bourgeoisie of all countries — inAmerica as well as in Europe — constantly commits,as often as the proletariat anywhere energetically moveto better their condition. It becomes, therefore, self-evident that the struggle of the proletariat with thebourgeoisie must have a violent, revolutionary char-acter.We could show by scores of illustrations that allattempts in the past to reform this monstrous systemby peaceable means, such as the ballot, have been fu-tile, and all such efforts in the future must necessarilybe so, for the following reasons:The political institutions of our time are theagencies of the propertied class; their mission is theupholding of the privileges of their masters; any re-form in your own behalf would curtail these privileges.To this they will not and cannot consent, for it wouldbe suicidal to themselves.That they will not resign their privileges volun-tarily we know; that they will not make concessionswe likewise know. Since we must then rely upon thekindness of our masters for whatever redress we have,and knowing that from them no good may be expected,there remains but one recourse — FORCE! Our fore-fathers have not only told us that against despots forceis justifiable, because it is the only means, but theythemselves have set the immemorial example.By force our ancestors liberated themselves frompolitical oppression, by force their children will haveto liberate themselves from economic bondage. “It is,therefore, your right, it is your duty,” says Jefferson —“to arm!”What we would achieve is, therefore, plainly andsimply:First:— Destruction of the existing ruling class,by all means, i.e., by energetic, relentless, revolution-ary, and international action.Second:— Establishment of a free society basedupon cooperative organization of production.Third:— Free exchange of equivalent productsby and between the productive organizations withoutcommerce and profit-mongery.Fourth:— Organization of education on a secu-lar, scientific, and equal basis for both sexes.Fifth:— Equal rights for all without distinctionto sex or race.Sixth:— Regulation of all public affairs by freecontracts between the autonomous (independent)communes and associations, resting on a federalisticbasis.Whoever agrees with this ideal, let him grasp ouroutstretched brother hands!Proletarians of all countries, unite!Fellow-workingmen, all we need for the achieve-ment of this great end is ORGANIZATION andUNITY!There exists now no great obstacle to that unity.The work of peaceful education and revolutionaryconspiracy well can and ought to run in parallel lines.The day has come for solidarity. Join our ranks!Let the drum beat defiantly the roll of battle: “Work-men of all countries unite! You have nothing to losebut your chains; you have a world to win!”Tremble, oppressors of the world! Not far be-yond your purblind sight there dawns the scarlet andsable lights of the JUDGEMENT DAY!",

    cardSubtitle: "First Universal Races Congress Will Mark Its Beginning",
    cardDetailedText: "London-  For the first time in human history there is a clear prospect of one ocmmon ideal animating all peoples, and thus the beautiful old hope of the brotherhood of nations and races is at last moving appreciably toward realization. What better means of celebrating the birth of the new era, of brusing aside the prejudices and suspicions or correcting misunderstandings than bymen and women from east and west, white and nonwhite, meeting as friends and equals in a great congress? We therefore earnestly appeal to all - most especially to symapthizers in the far and near east and in Africa and America - to make the utmost effor to attend personally the first universal races congress in London July 26 to 29 inclusive and convert it into an imposing and world moving demonstration in favor of interracial good will. The congress is truely what it purports to be -  an assembly of members of all the reaces of the world. Accordingly there are papers on China, Japan, Turkey, Persia, the Jewish race, India, Egypt, Haiti, the American Negro, and Indian and the Negro of West and South Africa. Hindu Scholar Will Open Program. In every one of these cases, we wish it to be noted, the paper is written by a member of the particular people or race concerned. while the very first paper of the congress is by a Hindu cholar, the congress executive recognizing that it might thus show its appreciation of the east. Ex oriente lux. It will rejoice the hearts of those who believe in interracial harmony to know that it is not the few, the despised or the eccentric who are cooperating in this congress, but the many, the honored and the experienced. Among the supporters, very many of whom have welcomed with the greatest enthusiasm the idea of holding such a congress and who belong to no less than fifty countries, are thirty presidents of parliament, the majority of the members of the permanent court of arbitration and of the delegates to the second Hague conference, twelve British governors and eight British prime ministers. many statesment and ambassadors. orver forty colonial bishops, some 130 professors of international law, the leading anthropologists and sociologists, the officers of the majority of the council of the interparlimentary union, not to particularize a multitude of other distinguished personages. Henceforth it will be impossible to deny that there exists a solid body of opinion among the most hifhly placed and most highly cultured in favor of just, respectul, and friendly relations between the peoples of the east and those of the west, between the so called whites and the so called colored, and the very remarkable unanimity in regard to fundametals among the distinguished writers of papers will emphasize this. Object and Aim of the Congress. The object of the congress, which will be held in the University of London, is to discuss in the light of modern knowledge and the modern conscience the general relations subsisting between the various peoples with a view to encouraging between them a fuller understading, the most friendly feeling and a heartoer cooperation. Political issues of the hour will be subordinated to this comprehensive end, in the firm belief that when once mutial respect is established difficulties of every type will be sympathetically approached and readily solved. We call on every one who chances to see this appeal to forward the high and holy cause of this congress by becoming a center of propoganda by attending the conference adn by inducing associations and public bodies to be represented. The American auxiliary commitee includes the names of many distinguished Americans like Jane Addams, John Grahm Brooks, President Faunce, Hamilton Holt, George Foster, Peabody, Hon, Joseph Choate, Hon Horace Porter, Lyman Abbott and Andrew Carnegie. The full program may be obtained free of charge and post free by writing to the secratary of the congress. Mr. G Spiller, 63 South Hill Park, Hampstead, London, England.
