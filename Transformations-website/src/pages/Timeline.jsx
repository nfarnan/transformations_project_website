    cardTitle: "The “Pittsburgh Proclamation.”",
    cardSubtitle: "Adopted by the Founding Congress of the American Federation of the International Working People’s Association",
    cardDetailedText:"Comrades! In the Declaration of Independence of the United States we read: When a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Has the moment not arrived to heed the advice of Thomas Jefferson, the true founder of the American Republic? Has government not become oppression? And is our government anything but a conspiracy of the ruling classes against the people — against you? Comrades! Hear what he have to say. Read our manifesto, written in your interest and for the welfare of your wives and children and toward the good of humanity and progress. Our present society is founded upon the exploitation of the propertyless class by the propertied. This exploitation is such that the propertied (capitalists) but the working force body and soul of the propertyless, for the price of the mere cost of existence (wages) and take for themselves, i.e., steal the amount of new values (products) which exceeds the price, whereby wagesare made to represent the necessities instead of the earnings of the wage-laborer. As the non-possessing classes are forced by their poverty to offer for sale to the propertied their working forces, and as our present production on a grandscale enforces technical development with immense rapidity, so that by the application of an always decreasing number of human working force, an always increasing amount of products is created; so does the supply of working force increase constantly, while the demand therefor decreases. This is the reason why the workers compete more and more intensely in selling themselves, causing their wages to sink, or at least on the average, never raising them above the margin necessary for keeping intact their working ability. Whilst by this process the property less are entirely debarred from entering the ranks of the propertied, even by the most strenuous exertions, the propertied, by means of the ever-increasing plundering of the working class, are becoming richer day by day, without in any way being themselves productive. If now and then one of the propertyless class become rich it is not by their own labor but from opportunities which they have to speculate upon, and absorb the labor-product of others. With the accumulation of individual wealth, the greed and power of the propertied grows. They use all the means for competing among themselves for the robbery of the people. In this struggle generally the less-propertied (middle class) are overcome, while the great capitalists, par excellence, swell their wealth enormously, concentrate entire branches of production as well as trade and intercommunication into their hands and develop into monopolists. The increase of products, accompanied by simultaneous decrease of the average income of the working mass of the people, leads to so-called “business” and “commercial” crises, when the misery of the wage-workers is forced to the extreme. For illustration: the last census of the United States shows that after deducting the cost of raw material, interest, rents, risks, etc., the propertied class have absorbed — i.e., stolen — more than five-eighths of all products, leaving scarcely three-eighths to the producers. The propertied class, being scarcely one-tenth of our population, ...in spite of their luxury and extravagance are unable to consume their enormous “profits,” and the producers, unable to consume morethan they receive — three-eighths — so-called “over-productions” must necessarily take place. The terrible results of panics are well known. The increasing eradication of working forces from the productive process annually increases the percentage of the propertyless population, which becomes pauperized and is driven to “crime,” vagabond-age, prostitution, suicide, starvation, and general depravity. This system is unjust, insane, and murderous. It is therefore necessary to totally destroy it with and by all means, and with the greatest energy on the party of everyone who suffers by it, and who does not wantto be made culpable for its continued existence by his inactivity. Agitation for the purpose of organization; organization for the purpose of rebellion. In these few wordsthe ways are marked which the workers must take if they want to be rid of their chains; as the economic condition is the same in all countries of so-called “civi-lization”; as the governments of all Monarchies and Republics work hand in hand for the purpose of opposing all movements of the thinking part of the workers; as finally the victory in the decisive combat of the proletarians against their oppressors can only be gained by the simultaneous struggle along the whole line ofthe bourgeois (capitalistic) society, so therefore the international fraternity of people as expressed in the International Working People’s Association presents itself a self-evident necessity. True order should take its place. This can only be achieved when all the implements of labor, the soil and other premises of production, in short, capital produced by labor, is changed into societary property. Only by this presupposition is destroyed every possibility of the future spoilation of man by man. Only by common, undivided capital can all be enabled to enjoy in their fullness the fruits of the common toil. Only by the impossibility of accumulating individual (pri-vate) capital can everyone be compelled to work who makes a demand to live. This order of things allows production to regulate itself according to the demand of the whole people, so that nobody need work more than a few hours a day, and that all nevertheless can satisfy their needs. Hereby time and opportunity are given for opening to the people the way to the highest possible civilization; the privileges of higher intelligence fall with the privileges of wealth and birth. To the achievement of sucha system the political organizations of the capitalistic classes — be they Monarchies or Republics — form the barriers. These political structures (States), whichare completely in the hands of the propertied, have no other purpose than the upholding of the present disorder of exploitation. All laws are directed against the working people.Insofar as the opposite appears to be the case, theyserve on the one hand to blind the worker, while onthe other hand they are simply evaded. Even the schoolserves only the purpose of furnishing the offspring ofthe wealthy with those qualities necessary to upholdtheir class domination. The children of the poor getscarcely a formal elementary training, and this, too, ismainly directed to such branches as tend to produc-ing prejudices, arrogance, and servility; in short, wantof sense. The Church finally seeks to make completeidiots out of the mass and to make them forego theparadise on earth by promising a fictitious heaven. Thecapitalistic press, on the other hand, takes care of theconfusion of spirits in public life. All these institutions,far from aiding in the education of the masses, havefor their object the keeping in ignorance of the people.They are all in the pay and under the direct control ofthe capitalistic classes. The workers can therefore ex-pect no help from any capitalistic party in their struggleagainst the existing system. They must achieve theirliberation by their own efforts. As in former times aAmerican Federation of the IWPA: “Pittsburgh Proclamation” [Oct. 1883] 3privileged class never surrendered its tyranny, neithercan it be expected that the capitalists of this age willgive up their rulership without being forced to do it.If there ever could have been any question onthis point it should long ago have been dispelled bythe brutalities of the bourgeoisie of all countries — inAmerica as well as in Europe — constantly commits,as often as the proletariat anywhere energetically moveto better their condition. It becomes, therefore, self-evident that the struggle of the proletariat with thebourgeoisie must have a violent, revolutionary char-acter.We could show by scores of illustrations that allattempts in the past to reform this monstrous systemby peaceable means, such as the ballot, have been fu-tile, and all such efforts in the future must necessarilybe so, for the following reasons:The political institutions of our time are theagencies of the propertied class; their mission is theupholding of the privileges of their masters; any re-form in your own behalf would curtail these privileges.To this they will not and cannot consent, for it wouldbe suicidal to themselves.That they will not resign their privileges volun-tarily we know; that they will not make concessionswe likewise know. Since we must then rely upon thekindness of our masters for whatever redress we have,and knowing that from them no good may be expected,there remains but one recourse — FORCE! Our fore-fathers have not only told us that against despots forceis justifiable, because it is the only means, but theythemselves have set the immemorial example.By force our ancestors liberated themselves frompolitical oppression, by force their children will haveto liberate themselves from economic bondage. “It is,therefore, your right, it is your duty,” says Jefferson —“to arm!”What we would achieve is, therefore, plainly andsimply:First:— Destruction of the existing ruling class,by all means, i.e., by energetic, relentless, revolution-ary, and international action.Second:— Establishment of a free society basedupon cooperative organization of production.Third:— Free exchange of equivalent productsby and between the productive organizations withoutcommerce and profit-mongery.Fourth:— Organization of education on a secu-lar, scientific, and equal basis for both sexes.Fifth:— Equal rights for all without distinctionto sex or race.Sixth:— Regulation of all public affairs by freecontracts between the autonomous (independent)communes and associations, resting on a federalisticbasis.Whoever agrees with this ideal, let him grasp ouroutstretched brother hands!Proletarians of all countries, unite!Fellow-workingmen, all we need for the achieve-ment of this great end is ORGANIZATION andUNITY!There exists now no great obstacle to that unity.The work of peaceful education and revolutionaryconspiracy well can and ought to run in parallel lines.The day has come for solidarity. Join our ranks!Let the drum beat defiantly the roll of battle: “Work-men of all countries unite! You have nothing to losebut your chains; you have a world to win!”Tremble, oppressors of the world! Not far be-yond your purblind sight there dawns the scarlet andsable lights of the JUDGEMENT DAY!",

Suit was brought by one Troy Mullins against the school trustees of district in Pike county, demanding the admittance of some children of whom he acted as guardian. The Pike County court denied the children admittance to the school holding that they were 'colored.' being of one-sixteenth Negro blood and under the state law prohibiting 'colored childern' from attending a white school, were therefore debarred. the case was carried to the court of appeals and the decision of that court has the effect of upholding the Pike county court and the school trustee who refused to enroll the children as pupils.",

    cardSubtitle: "First Universal Races Congress Will Mark Its Beginning",
    cardDetailedText: "London-  For the first time in human history there is a clear prospect of one ocmmon ideal animating all peoples, and thus the beautiful old hope of the brotherhood of nations and races is at last moving appreciably toward realization. What better means of celebrating the birth of the new era, of brusing aside the prejudices and suspicions or correcting misunderstandings than bymen and women from east and west, white and nonwhite, meeting as friends and equals in a great congress? We therefore earnestly appeal to all - most especially to symapthizers in the far and near east and in Africa and America - to make the utmost effor to attend personally the first universal races congress in London July 26 to 29 inclusive and convert it into an imposing and world moving demonstration in favor of interracial good will. The congress is truely what it purports to be -  an assembly of members of all the reaces of the world. Accordingly there are papers on China, Japan, Turkey, Persia, the Jewish race, India, Egypt, Haiti, the American Negro, and Indian and the Negro of West and South Africa. Hindu Scholar Will Open Program. In every one of these cases, we wish it to be noted, the paper is written by a member of the particular people or race concerned. while the very first paper of the congress is by a Hindu cholar, the congress executive recognizing that it might thus show its appreciation of the east. Ex oriente lux. It will rejoice the hearts of those who believe in interracial harmony to know that it is not the few, the despised or the eccentric who are cooperating in this congress, but the many, the honored and the experienced. Among the supporters, very many of whom have welcomed with the greatest enthusiasm the idea of holding such a congress and who belong to no less than fifty countries, are thirty presidents of parliament, the majority of the members of the permanent court of arbitration and of the delegates to the second Hague conference, twelve British governors and eight British prime ministers. many statesment and ambassadors. orver forty colonial bishops, some 130 professors of international law, the leading anthropologists and sociologists, the officers of the majority of the council of the interparlimentary union, not to particularize a multitude of other distinguished personages. Henceforth it will be impossible to deny that there exists a solid body of opinion among the most hifhly placed and most highly cultured in favor of just, respectul, and friendly relations between the peoples of the east and those of the west, between the so called whites and the so called colored, and the very remarkable unanimity in regard to fundametals among the distinguished writers of papers will emphasize this. Object and Aim of the Congress. The object of the congress, which will be held in the University of London, is to discuss in the light of modern knowledge and the modern conscience the general relations subsisting between the various peoples with a view to encouraging between them a fuller understading, the most friendly feeling and a heartoer cooperation. Political issues of the hour will be subordinated to this comprehensive end, in the firm belief that when once mutial respect is established difficulties of every type will be sympathetically approached and readily solved. We call on every one who chances to see this appeal to forward the high and holy cause of this congress by becoming a center of propoganda by attending the conference adn by inducing associations and public bodies to be represented. The American auxiliary commitee includes the names of many distinguished Americans like Jane Addams, John Grahm Brooks, President Faunce, Hamilton Holt, George Foster, Peabody, Hon, Joseph Choate, Hon Horace Porter, Lyman Abbott and Andrew Carnegie. The full program may be obtained free of charge and post free by writing to the secratary of the congress. Mr. G Spiller, 63 South Hill Park, Hampstead, London, England.

    cardDetailedText: "Washington. -(Special.)- The flurry over the disposition of the Ninth cavalry is at an end. By order of Gen. Leonard Wood, chief of staff, the colored troops will take their turn at patrolling the Mexican border and will replace the Third cavalry, relieving the latter in order that it may have a chanve to recieve instructions in the maneuver camp at San Antonio. General Carter, in command of the maneuver division, will have charge of the distribution of the Ninth cavalry, and while Sam Fordyce, Laredo, Eagle Pass, Marathon, Presidio del Notre, Marga,Hancock, Manora and other points on the Rio Grande will be covered. It is expressly stated that under no circumstances will they be sent to Brownsville, of 25th Infantry fame. The Ninth will be the divisional cavalry of the maneuver division. The war department will pay no serious attention to the howl raised by a few of the border towns, which do not want a Negro regiment 'in their midst.' Even in Washington, Post has had the generosity to say that 'it goes against the grain of a Texas white man to see a Negro in military uniform, manupulating a gun,' adding sagely that 'it has the same effect upon them as the waving of a red flag in the face of a bull.' The matter of placing the colored troops is always a delicate problem, north or south, and in this particular instance it is evident that the president and the war department are determined to do their level best too preserve the peace, maintain the dignity of the army establishment, and use the gallant Ninth according to the needs of the service, independent of the whims and absurd fears of the bourbons along the Texan frontier. No one here believes that in sturring up this racial embroglio, Representative Garner has chosen 'the better part'",

    cardSubtitle: "James R. Harris in Illinois Chronicle",
    cardDetailedText: "We have on our desk a book entitied “My Brother.” a series of essays and addresses by Dr. Amory H. Bradford. and one of the finest expositions of the doctrine of “human brotherhood” it has been our good fortune to see. With rare insight, the doctor talks of the dangers to society that follow a denial of equal chances in life to all men. regardless of class or race. He reproves The church for her failure to induce men to “practice in their lives what they profess with their lips.” and to our mind the reproof is strictly merited. There is no trouble between the races: there is no maladjustment between the weak and the strong which cannot be lessened by following the teaching of Confucius: “Do not unto others that you sould not have them do to you,” or the positive statement of the same truth by Christ: “Do unto others, that you would they should do unto you.” “The university and the pulpit.” he declares. “are the hope of the world.” This is true. Civilized men are, after all. but cultured barbarians, and the old proverb: “Scratch a Russian and find a Tartar.” is true in spirit of the great majority. We boast our enlightenment—pride ourselves upon our Intellectual and moral excellence, yet In the final analysis, things are largely in the bands of the brass-buttoned gentleman who stands on the corner with a club or a black jack in his hand. True it is, that we have taken the rings out of our noses and we no longer paint (that is, most of us), yet in our treatment of the weak and the helpless we still believe In that good old rule, the simple plan: “That they may take who have the power, And they may Keep, who can.” We have just received the third of the series of monographs being published by the American Negro Monograph company, Washington, D.C. Its theme is-the life of Benjamin Banneker, the great negro mathematician, who did so much to dispel doubt of the negro’s mental capacity in the eighteenth century, and who was not only a recipient of letters of admiration and encouragement from Thomas Jefferson, but also an honored guest at the executive mansion during the administration of that great man. Without any of the numerous tables and other astronomical data, which must go so far toward lessening the diffculties of such a task, Mr Banneker compiled an almanac for the year 1732, which feat won the applause of many of the lending scientists of the day. He later sent a copy In the original manuscript to President Jefferson and accompanied it with a letter from which we quote: “Sir—I am fully sensible of the greatness of that freedom which I now. take with you on the present occasion, a liberty which seemed to me scarcely allowable. when I reflected on that distinguished and dignified station In which you stand, and the almost general prejudice and prepossession which is prevalent in the world against those of my complexion. I suppose it is a truth too well attested to you to need a proof here, that we are a race of beings who have long labored under the abuse and censure of the world; that we have long been considered as brutish rather than human and scarcely capable of mental endowments. Sir, I hope I may safely admit, in consequence of report which hath reached me, that you are a man far less inflexible in sentiments of this nature than many others; that you are measurably friendly and well disposed toward us. and that you are ready and willing to lend your aid and assistance to our relief from those many distressed and numerous calamlties to which we are reduced. Sir—I suppose that your knowledge of the situation of my brethren is too extensivé to need a recital here; neither shall I presume to prescribe methods by which they may be relieved. otherwise than by recommending to you and all others to wean yourselves from those narrow prejudices which you have imbibed with respect to them and as Job propored to his friends. Put your souls in their souls instead. thus shall your hearts be enlarged with kindness and benevolence toward them, and thus shall you need neither the directicn of myself nor others in what manner to proceed therein. This calculation sir is the production of my arduous study in this my advanced stage of life; for having long had unbounded desires to become acquainted with the secrets of nature, I have had to gratify my curiosity herein through my own assiduous applicaiton of astronomical study, in which I need not to recount to you the many difficulties and disadvantages I have had to encounter. We have qunted the letter at length that the reader may get an Idea of the very intelligent way in which this self-taught negro expressed himself. Banneker died in 1804 and no marked shaft marks the site of his resting place: we mention this fact with shame. A people's character is interpereted int terms of its appreciation for its great men, and we hope the day is not far distant when our its whose name Benjamin Bannker lived and wrought, may in some way show their gratitude by distinguishing the spot of bis burial. The ten best-selling books in. fiction for 1910 were the following: The Rosary. A Modern Chroticle When a Man Marries, John Marvel. Thruxton King. The Silver Horde. Lord Loveland Discovers America. The Kingdom of Slender Swords. Simon the Jester and ‘Nathan Burke.” It is interesting to note that of the thirty “best sellers,” nineteen were written by men and eleven by women. Of course, being a “best seller” does not make a book Literature, yet popolarity does not imply a lack of merit and most of. the above given list will repay perusal. In one of the magazines we read an article on “The New Japan,” in which was expresséd great concern over the rapid growth in power and prestige which the island-empire has made in the last half century. Occldegtal nations are justified in, their speculations about Japan’s future. Suppose, for Instance, that she finds it possible to arouse the Chinese from their sleep of centuries, and to inspire them with their own dynamic energies—think, reader, what a power this yellow empire might become! Some idea of the enormous population of China can be formed when we remember that if we could place all the men in the world side by side in one long ine, first an Englishman, then an American, ete. every fourth man would be a Chinaman. One of the sources of Oriental strength !a their impenetrability—the occidental mind cannot see behind the mask, or as Kipling puts it: “It is not good for the Christian race To worry the Aryan “brown, For the white man riles, And the brown man smiles, And it weareth the Christian down; Andghe énd of thé fight Is a tombstone white With the name of the late deceased, And the epitaph clear, “A fool lies here Who tried to hurry the east.” Or as another writer who also knows his subject, puts it 'The brooding east with awe beheld Her, impious younger world; The Roman tempest swelled and swelled. And on her head was hurled. The east bow'd low before the blast, In patient. deep disdain; ‘She let the legions thunder past And plunged in thought again,' The recent magnificent showing by the negroes of Chicago in raising so great a sum of money for the Y. M. C. A. movement simply proves conclusively that in this city the brains and wealth of the race is to be found. This one incident has done more to raise our people in the estimation of the world than all the editorials ever written. A people who can in ten days secure $66,000 for any given purpose must be reckoned with. When we remember that our people are wage earners largely, and often for policy’s sake, are deterred in making large contributions to public enterprises, even when able so to do, the result of this effort is all the more commendable. We thought we were doing a great thing here in Louisville in attempting to raise $15,000, but we take off our hats to Chicago, promising to be in the future.",

    cardSubtitle: "Large Attendance at First Meeting in Labor Temple Last Sunday",
    cardDetailedText: "About 350 members of the race responded to the call of the American Federation of Labor invitation to be present at a meeting at Labor Temple on last Sunday for the purpose or taking steps to become affiliated with that organization. The large gathering and the interest manifested certainly showed the colored man is always ready to grasp even at a straw at it were to join hands with his white brother in any good movement that has for its object the uplift of all people. The meeting was called to order by Mr. Flynn, whose sincerity in his deaire to do the square thing by the colored brother, we hare no reason to doubt. Fiynn Opens Doors to Colored Men. He said the doors of the American Federation of Labor were opened to the colored men and that while in some parts of the country a feeling existed against admitting the colored men, the only way to break down the doors of those still opposing was to get colored men to join the American Federation in places where this feeling does not exist. We cannot expect great things from the start, and it may take a year or two to bring a complete affiliation in all organizations with the colored race. Irish Had Struggle Too. He cited the hardships of his own race, the Irish, whom his mother said, used to be stoned. Now it was up to them to try to educate the colored man and white man to realize the brotherhood of man. You will find the colored brother now in many parts of the country in the counsels of labor organizations as delegates. At the last international convention held here at the Monongahela house, a colored man from Youngstown represented the brickmakers association of that city. McCulfough Lauds Black Man's Efforts .Mr. J. W. McCullough, an ex-president of the United Mine Workers, followed with a vary forcible and impressive speech that showed that his heart was in the right place. He hit right from the shoudder and received much applause for his manly utterances. He spoke of the many wrongs that hed been perpetrated upon the black man, told how they had been brought to this country as slaves. He said the laboring man was now in a wage system of slavery, but the condition of employment today should be this, if you have more knowledge than I, you will be employed and if I have more knowledge than you, I will be employed. The question that is asked today is what is the price? They do not ask Whether it was made by a White man or back man. It is now a question of reaching down to help the other fellow up and as you rise you can help to elevate others of your race. He spoke of the great progress the colored race had made in its ten years of freedom, and is taking its place along side of the white man in all walks of life. if what the race has accomplished in about 10 years is to be considered. you ought to be able to double what you have done within the next 20 years. In fact, there is no limit to the possibilities of the colored man. You will be respected according to what you do for yourself. He said the race has been too contented with work for low wages True, there are places where white men will not work with colored men, but those white men cannot but realize soonor or later that they will be the loosers, and will be brought to see the folly of their position. We all need to get on the same broad platform that knows no creed, color, or nationality and raise the highest standard we can set for each other. Geo. M. Robb Joins Heartily. Mr. Geo. Robb followed with a short speech .to the point. He said he was willing to take a chance and join the American Federation! and that we as colored citizens, have always Been loyal to every movement that the white man has put forward that had for its object the uplift of mankind. While we have been known. as strike breakers, it has been because we could never heretofore be strike makers, but that wé now feel that the Divine hand that carries the destiny of nations has put it into the hands of these men to have us be come part of this great industrial body. The question is. Are we to now members, and is only a question be recognized and acorded the same protection as the white brother! And will your motto be ‘I am my brothers keeper?' We don't want to be used at 'cat’s paws' to pull you out of the fire. Mr. Flynn replied that it was a very difficult problem to get all the white People to think alone. The American Federation of Labor has been advocating for 20 years the same privilege to the colored man as to the white and in fact no organization can affiliate with the American Federation of Labor and exclude the colored man. There are quite a few craftr at present in which the colored men are of time until unions will admit them, What we want to do today Is to get you properly organized and if you have any particular trade to transfer you to your respective organization and if you are not have no particular trade you will become affiliated directly with the American Federation of Labor. We want to see If your people are sincere and while we realize that it is going to take a year of two to get everything in good order and get the results deserved by all, you can start out today for the foundation of this organization. Organization Effected. Mr. N. W. Rickmond was eiected temporary chairman, and a better selection could not have been made. After several declinations Mr. Thos. Wilson was: elected temporary secretary. Mr. Flynn stated the charter would cost $10 and membership fee should be ai least 50 cents. Mr. Geo. Robb, the well known and popular proprietor of the Colonial hotel, whose heart is as big as his body. said he would defray the expense of the charter and present it free to the organization and when the temporary orsanization was effected his $10 was forthcoming. At this meeting a good number of names was enrolled for membership and adout half of the men paid their 50 cents, There will be another meeting at the Labor Temple next Sunday at 2 p.m. Every colored man who has any, race pride and wants to do something for the advancement of his race along industrial lines should be present at that meeting. We cannot see how you have anything to lose and if the promoters of this movement are sincere in their efforts to play fair with the colored man, the race and the American Federation of labor will both reap the benefit. It is certainly worth a fair trial.",

    cardDetailedText: "In looking’ over and studying the various mission fields of the world, our hearts are made to feel sad over the deplorable condition of parts of the human race. The sad tales of India, China and other races, draw forth our deeper sympathy, but when we come to the dark continent of Africa. it is here we take our stand, it is here we hang our harps upon the willow tree and weep because of the woeful condition. and great need of our black brother. The Indian mother throws her baby into the angry river to appease the wrath of her god, the Chinaman bows down,to his image of wood, Mohammedism Claims other worshipers, but when we see the poor black man bound in ignorance, cannibalism, and superstition we feel the great responsibility that rests on us as a part of the human race. Yet all Africa is not dark and benighted. some parts are civilized and the natives are christianized. but that is not the part that needs our help worst. We would find the souls in darkness lying. where no light has broken through. And we need only to look in Darker Africa to find these souls: men and women, boys and. girls who have never heard of the Saviour. whose condition is pitiful to behold. They are ignorant, without raiment and living in superstition, uncivilized: some are cannibals living in rush villages or roaming the forest; all human beings that fall prey to them are cooked and eaten. They believe in devils, Witchery, evil omens: if a snake crawls Into one’s hut the snake is a harbinger of evil. If a native dies his spirit goes into a hog or some wild animal. And yet with all their savagery they are a people that are . willing and eager to learn of His love so deep and dear of the precious price that -------- of the nail, the thorn the spear. Their need is great and we cannot deny them the light of life. civilization must spread over this dark land, Their first great need is the Gospel. let them have the light of salvation. Learn of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. Noble men and women have answered the call of the wild; they have gone forth to plant the blood stained banner of Christ to drive out the superstition to banish death and darkness. but it is not easy sailing. There are dangers and hardships to be encountered is counted not precious. How many today sleep under African sod? Their work was not in vain they struck a blow to African heathenism that made it better. Now it is beginning to fall. soon it will crumble. They have sown the seed of religon, others will reap the harvest they have gone to reap their reward. As we have done it unto these the least of them brethren, ye have done it unto me. But have we conscientiously helped to suppiy the needs of this people? Thousands of dollars. Bibles, books, clothes, men and women. are given to the cause. How great the supply, yet the demand is greater: we still hear the cry. 'come over and help us.' First give them the Gospel, then houses of worship and then schools where they can be taught thrift, industry and skill. instead of the rush hut, build houses. instead of roaming as savages. till the soil To do all this there must be means. The missionary of the field sees the great need and appeals to civilized America to help. Let us look back, over the past three hundred years. We see twenty trembling bound Negroes carried to New York dock and sold as slaves. As the years advance. they increase to hundreds—thousands—to millions. and broad east over the land. It seems hard that they should have suffered the bitterness and gall of slavery. Yet it was God's hand in it all. Suffered it to be so that we as a mass. might be civilized and christianized to better help our fellow man across the ocean. Why was Moses reared in the house of Pharaoh? Why was he taught the fine arts and given such high training? It was God's plan, that he might better lead and help the people, Then we are Zion. the chosen of God. Chosen to do a great work, chosen to save from peril of perdition the souls for whom Christ died, the instrumants of God's hand. We are all missionaries of the Christian religion, pledged to help our fellow men There are, many ways in which we can help spread the gospel. Give of our means, give our young men and women give our prayers and tears. give ourselves. Then while we are Kneeling worshiping God, under our own vine and fig tree, let us not forget the poor African boys and girls that Rev. East spoke of in his letter. without clothes, without a place of worship. and althougd we cannot give thousands, let us give in proportion as God has given to us to help him in hss great work. You that have not been roused to the sense of your duty, do so before it is too late and 'Haste spread the tiding Wide to earth’s remotest strand Let no brothers bitter chidings Rise against you when you stand In the Judgement From some far forgotten land'. The sudject of this sketch was born at Washington, D. C. August 29, 1872, where he spent his early years. He was converted to the Christian faith when fourteen years old and was baptized by Rev. Dr. R. V. Peyton in the Potomac river. Rev. Saunders attended the public school at his native home and received a fair education. Realizing his call to the gospel ministry he made it known to his pastor, the Rev. R. V. Payton, who gave him an opportunity to preach at a trial sermon. After preaching forsome time a council was called to consider the advisibility of ordaining him. Failing to meet the requirements of the council he was requested to study a little more and then try again in two months time. Prurposing to be able to satisfy the next council this young man worked hard at his trade as brickmaking and studied at night. Some time was spent With a private teacher. Things became slow at Washington D.C. in line of work knowing that he had a wife and three little ones to take care of he moved to Philadelphia Pa., where he and his wife worked and saved a few dollars. Leaving Philadelphia he came back to Washington D. C. After spending what little they had accumulated he set sail for Pittsburgh. he was called to the Central Baptist church to succeed the Rey. Dr. F. G. Bookins, feeling that he was able to meet the requirements a council was called July 11, 1905, to consider his ordination. Rev A. W. Puller catechiser, Rev. Dr. R. R. Jones, moderator and Rev. Dr. W. W. Brown secretary. Rev. Saunders received an impartial examination and was ordained. Rev. Dr. Pulier preached his ordination sermon. This young man has pastored several small churches in Pittsburgh, Pa. and vicinity, but feeling that God had something better in store for him he never despaired the day of small things. He succeeded the Rev. J. C. Faulton at the First Baptist church. Finleyville. Pa. Rev. Saunders owes much of his success to his energetic wife who labored hard to help him. working out at day and hearing his lessons at night. being further advanced in some branches of common school. She sat up late with him. Rev Saunders is now pastor of the Bethlehem Baptist church, vice president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Pittsburgh and vicinity and secretary of the sare. having been three times elected as secretary.

    cardDetailedText: "In order to find out tho attitude of northern colleges toward negro students, Atlanta universfty (colored) sent a circular letter to several hundred institutions asking the names and addresses of students and graduates of negro descent and how they were regarded by the faculty and the student body. Many illuminating replies were received. Yale university answered that it never tried to attract negro students, but never felt justified In refusing admittance to those who came. At Leland Stanford there was said to be no hostility whatever toward colored students. Fordham university, New York, replied that it had never had negro applicants for admission, and if any should come it was impossible to say what reception they would ‘meet. At St. Vincent college, in Pennsylvania, it was said frankly that 'we do not think it wise under prevailing conditions to accept any distinctively colored students into the college.' Naturally none of the northern state universities draw the color line. In Missouri the line is sharply drawn. The president of Carleton college, in that state, writes: 'I have not found a student in the state who would tolerate a negro in the college, and it is even worse since the Johnson-Jeffries fight.' So It seems that while Mr. Johnson won the championship, he did not help the cause af negro education in Missouri. Nearly every year since 1826, when a negro was graduated from Bowdoin college, there’ have been colored graduates from the leading colleges of New England.—Boston Globe.    ",

    cardDetailedText: "‘NOT OPPOSING THE INTERCHURCH COLLEGE, BUT PREFER WORK WITHIN OUR CHURCH,' SAYS THE BISHOP. Nashville, Tena.—‘No, we are not opposing the Interchurch college, we are simply taking the position that all the work which is done by our church for the colored teachers and preachers should be done through the agencies of the church and not through any independent or allen instrumentality.' This is the statement made by Bishop E. E. Hoss in answer to a question as to whether or not the Methodist Episcopal church South, is opposing the American Interchurch college in its relation to social and religious training among the colored people. A called meeting of the executive board of education of the Methodist Episcopal church South, of which Bishop Hoss is a member, was held yesterday afternoon at the office of Dr. Percy  Maddin, also a member, and resolutions were adopted indorsing Paine college in Augusta, Ga., and the administration of the present officials was strongly commended. A communication from the board of missions was read in reference to the enlargement of the facilities for training colored preachers in Paine college and such additional facilities are thoroughly Approved by the executive committee. Similar action was taken by a special committee appointed for the purpose of determining the policy of the church in regard to the training of negro teachers and preachers. This special committee met yesterday also, the meeting being held at the publishing house and Paine college was indorsed unanimously. This committee consisted, of Bishop H. McCoy, Dr. J. D. Hammond, Senator John H. Sherard, Dr. John M. Moore and Mrs. MacDonald. Sitting with the committee by special invitation yesterday were Dr. E. B. Chappell of the Sunday school board and Mr. Stonewall Anderson, secretary of the board of education. One of the most Interesting features of the meeting was an account given by Senator Sherard of a visit to Mound Fayou, Miss., where the entire popuation is colored. The visit of Senator Sherard was greatly appreciated and a paper expressing this appreciation embodied the statement that there was an urgent need of sermons from the White ministers of the southern Methodist church. It was the sense of the committee expressed in a resolution offered by Doctor Moore, that the Methodist Episopal church, South, should operate through the Colored Methodist Episcopal church directly in all its efforts toward social and religious training of the negno. and in all other lines of work, but that the advantages offered by the church should also be open to the people of other colored churches, and especidlly to the Colored Methodist churches. This resolution was adopted. The committee also will recommend that the trustees of Paine college in Augusta, Ga. be respectfully asked to give consideration to the advisabiity of enlarging the department for the training of preachers at Paine college. and of establishing a correspondence school for colored preachers in the church. The following resolutions were adopted: 'In view of the need of enlarging the work of Paine college in several directions, it is recommended that we request the board of education to consider the matter of authorizing the president of Paine college to set about raising immediately an endowment for the college. Assured of raising funds for current expenses. It was also recommended that the board of missions give its hearty indorsement and pledge Its support to such a movement. 'Resolved, That the secretaries of the home department take steps looking to the holding of Sunday school institutes among the colored people. and that as a means to this end, the services of Doctor Chappell and his assistants be! secured in the enlistment of the general Sunday school board and of the conference Sunday school boards in this work.' The question of employing young women. and others, in training Sunday school teachers in the cities was discussed, and the following resolutions were adopted: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that specially equipped and well-trained persons be employed by the home department of the board of missions: to teach and train groups of colored Methodist Sunday school teachers In-our cities; and, 'Resolved. That this committee call attention to those pastors and city mission boards that employ deaconesses and other trained workers to the opportunity which they have in them to help in the development of the religious and moral life of the negroes. and to arrange for such use of them as shall lead to the accomplishment of this end.' The following resolution was also adopted: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that our home secretaries should use all legitimate means to arouse public sentiment among the white people in the communities where there is a large colored population in favor of proper housing and sanitation among the negroes, and that efforts should be made to enlist employers of negroes in towns, cities and country in reasonable plans for the social better ment of the negroes in their employ. The committee hereby expresses its sympathy with sane and well matured negroes who are making efforts to bring about through their leagues the educational, industrial and moral improvement of their people.” After discussing the question of training colored workers the following resolution was adopted: 'We beieve that Paine college should, be the educational center through which the Methodist Episcopal church, South, should at present undertake to prepare colored men and women for religious service. We respectfully recommend that the board of education and the board of missions and the trustees of Paine college consider the advisability at their next meeting of establishing a training school as a department of Paine college for the training and equipment of young women deaconesses, settlement workers, Sunday school teachers and for other religious work.'",

    title: "December 16, 1911",
    cardTitle: "Negro Labor Ignored",
    cardDetailedText: "The David Williams Company of New York City, publishes a weekly magazine entitled The Iron Age, devoted to the Iron and steel industries in the country. Under date of November 25 appears an article written and contributed by Mr. H. P. Bope, one of the leading steel men of our time, and a Pittsburgher. The subject of his article is 'Future Development of the Middle West.' He begins by taking the steel industry as an example. and applying his conclusions to all others. After showing the remarkable progress made in the steel industry and picturing a most optimistic view as to the future, Mr. Bope presents what he is pleased to call 'certain obstacles' which must be overcome, and 'certain dangers which are of tremendous importance.' These he classifies under three separate heads as follows: Legislative, Financial and Economic, the last of which he considers 'dangerous,' and discusses it at length under the head, 'Insufficient Supply of Common Labor.' The writer states that he has had more than thirty years of actual experience In the steel businéss, having worked himself up from the proverbial ground floor; hence the significance of his opinion. He states that when he first entered the steel business, the Irish were the one source of common labor, and he asserts that it was 'the best we ever had.' He explains that Irish labor grew scarce because they, 'recognising the opportunities of this country, sent their children to the public schools,' and the children, upon reaching maturity, belng fittied for higher positions in life, became foremen instead of common laborers as were thelr fathers. And the restilt is that common labor among the Irish is not as available as it was, and he adds, it never will be. 'The Irish. says Mr. Bope, were succeeded the Slav and Hun, but they were never equal to the increasing demand, nor was theirs the best labor, except under certain conditions.' Europe can no longer be depended upon to supply us with common labor. and there seems to be an inherent opposition to the use of the Japanese and the Chinese, since yellow and white do not mix. even in such a capacity. The conclusion of Mr. Bope is that the one great problem now facing the industrial world is that of common labor: and with whe supply of the Irish, the Stav, the the Hun, exhausted and the inhérent opposition to yellow labor so pronounced, he sees a perplexing situation ahead. That Mr. Bepe does not even consider the Negro labarer Is too apparent for comment. That he has no intention of considering him in the future is obvious from the picture he paints. He sees the passing of the Irish. the Slav, the Hun, and admits the impossibility of yellow labor. but, even in the last extremity, he neglects to consider the Negro either as a possible resolt in time of dire necessity, or as a future agency on which to depend when the Slav and the Hun, like their Irish predecessors, have educated their children 'for higher positions of life.' and have been promoted from the position of common labor to the more refined foremanship. The words of Mr. Bape have more than a common significance. His attitude as pictured in his article spells the elimination of the Negro from the industrial development of this country. That such is the policy of the industrial heads of today can not be denied in the face of the slleat rebuke of Mr. Bope. In the face of the past record of the Negro, we ask what has Mr. Bope or the industrial magnates to fear? Wé take pleasure in calling attention to the fact that the Negro has at all times when called upon, shown himself efficient and satisfactory. We have but to refer to the Homestead strike for sufficient proof of what the Negro will do when the white man does him the honor to employ him. From strike-breaking to the battlefield the Negro has labored in the interest of this country, and like Mr, Bope, we measure the future by the past to the extent of warranting the indus tries of the country that when they feel disposed to give the black man a chance, an equal chance, with the Irish, the Slav, the Hun or the European to show his efficiency as a laborer, he will not be found wanting. If the passing of the Irish, Slav and Hun means the creation of a necessity for Negro labor, we pray most ardently for such a consummation; believing as we do in the loyalty of the Negro to his country as well as in his natural fitness for American labor, with neither socialistic nor anarchistic tendencies. Unless Mr. Bope means to eliminate the Negro from the development of the Middle West, there need be no fear of 'insufficiency of common labor.'",

    cardDetailedText: " A recent issue of the Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser calls attention to a speech made by Gov. Emmet O'Neal before the conference of the A. M. E. church recently in session at Mont- gomery. Ala.  It is, interesting to use to note how these colored people in the south get on with leading officials. Seldom or never does one read of the governor of a northern state attending any of the conferences of our people, nor do we read of any of them offering words of advice which will help to encourage colored people to better liv- ing. As a rule, northern governors are never to be found around colored people except when they are seeking their votes. The report of this inci- dent in the far south, however, is so interesting that we are publishing it herewith fust as it appears in the Ad- vertiser: “The fourth day’s session of the A. M. E. conference, which Is in session at the Madison Avenue church, was a gala day for negro Methodists of the state. The principal feature of the day being an address by Gov. Emmet O'Neal, who had been invited to speak before the conference.  “At high noon all available space In the auditorium was filled by ne- groes who had turned out to do honor to the chief magistrate of Alabama. A committee headed by Rev. R. L. Pope, the pastor of the church, met the governor in front of the church and escorted him to the platform. Dr. W. H. Mixon of Selma, Ala., made the address in presenting him to Rt. Rev. H. B. Parks, the presiding bishop, who introduced the governor to the con- ference. A Chautauqua salute wa given, amid long applause. Governor O'Neal assured the conference of his sympathy for and interest in the ne gro ministry He said:  'No class counts for so much in the uplift and advancement of your; people as does the negro ministry. It is for the interest of the white man; as well as the black man to have the negro educated in the sciences and handicrafts of our civilization. To al- low the negro to remain among us ignorant and vile may prove to be a weight about our necks to drag us downs. While in New York some weeks ago, I was interviewed by the New York Journal. In answer to the question, was the negro’s uncontrolla- ble thirst for strong drink responsible for the failure of prohibition in the south, I said emphatically, no. I was born and reared among negroes and for twenty-fve years I practiced at the bar in Lauderdale county, yet I do not recall two negroes who were confirmed drunkards. i can never forget tbe loyalty of your race during the Civil war. History does not re- count another instance where a serv- ant race exhibited such loyalty to the master as has been exhibited by the American negro. I can never forget you. And so long as I occupy the governors chair I shall do all in my power to see that even-handed justice is meted out to every citizen of this commonwealth, be he rich or poor, black or white.’ Bishop Parks replied to the gov- ernor’s address. 'At the close of the reply a reso lution of thanks was offered the gov- ernor.' When strong men like Governor O'Neal are willing to speak out open- ly in praise of the loyalty of negroes and in determined assurance of his intention to mete out even-handed justice to blacks and whites alike they are entitled to our thanks. For one, The Age intends to give proper report to all.such incidents. It is the king of thing for which we publish this newspaper—New York Age. A New Orleans paper takes great pains to point out the desirability of giving the negro a square deal, and refers to many disabilities under which the negro labors in the south and nation. Some injustice may be expected under the circumstances. When it comes to the courts it is bet- ter that the negro stay out of them. The sooner the negro learns how to attend to his business and to avoid clashes with any and everybody the sooner he will learn the lesson which present unfavorable conditions are de- signed to teach. The point is not to be concerned too much about the privileges that are denied and to be concerned about the right use of those which are retained. —Durham (N. C.) Reformer. 'Have you ever thought of it—that great Son of Palestine was a carpen- ter’s son,' sald Dr. E. G. Hirsch of Chicago, in an address at Tuskegee Institute. 'He did not have a class- ical education, but he learned the les- son of life in his father’s carpenter shop; he did not go to academies, but he heard his divine father’s call. Whatever message he bad. be clothed it in the phraseology, not of the counting-room, and not of the draw ing-room, but into the impressive ,Vo- cabulary of the farmer and the ar- tisan. In practicing and learning to practice the religion of labor. you be come Christianized. in the spirit of the great teacher, and Judaized tn the spirit of the great Jewish prophets.' A number of industrious colored boys could find profitible employment after school bours and learn a valu- able trade if they could be induced to put in a few hours around either or both of the local colored printing  shops. There are too many colored boys wearing out valuable shoe leath-  er on Commerce street smoking cig arettes and going to the bad general- ly.—San Antonio Inquirer.   Spend your money with your race. They are struggling to build you up; so belp them.  There is no occasion for alarm on the part of the white people of this state because the negro population shows a slightly larger rate of in- crease. They still outnumber the colored people about eighteen to one, thus making the fear of “negro dom ination” groundless. The negroes, however, cannot view the increase of their number with as little concern, for the reason that it has come about very largely through migration from other states of a type of undesirablee, of men brought here to labor in the industrial centers, who too frequently mistake license for liberty. Coming as they mostly do from Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky where wages are lower, school terms are shorter and the at- titude of the whites toward them is more hostile than In this state, they are endangering the civil and political privileges not only of themselves, but of the entire race in West Virginia. This state of affairs has come about through the development of coal mining and the consequent demand for labor. In but few instances have the law-abiding, property-owning negroes of other states responded. Those who have heeded the call are, for the most part, the unattached, ignorant, happy-golucky element who are the best patrons of the saloonkeeper and form the reserve force from which the population of the penitentiary is recruited. This being the situation those negroes in the state who have any regard for their civil and political status must “view with alarm” this influx and hope that it will either be diverted or that those who come bere after may be of a higher type; otherwise, the movement for Jim Crow cars and disfranchisement will grow apace.—Charleston (S. C.) Advocate. The People’s Investment and Savings bank of Birmingham, Ala, Dr. W. L. Lauderdale, president, closed its doors, says the Birmingham American. In explanation of the trouble, Dr. Lauderdale has issued the following statement: 'By a special call of the board of directors of the People’s Investment and Savings bank by President W. L. Lauderdale, after a brief discussion pertaining to the affairs of the bank and Its best interest, since its robbery which disturbed the confidence of its depositors, the board did not deem It, wise, nor for the best interest of an parties concerned, to continue its present operations, and in view of this fact a resolution was passed calling on Hon. A. E. Walker, superintendent of banks of Alabama, to take the affairs of the bank in hand and liquidate its indebredness to secure the best interest of the depositors of the bank. 'The president and board further feel that In their judgment the bank has sufficient assets to pay its depositors in full.' Thomas L. Masson, editor of Life, recently delivered a lecture on 'Newspapers' before the students of the Glen Ridge (N. J.) high school. The speaker explained that there are three vocabularies in common use. These he classified as the ‘social vocabulary, literary vocabulary and the vocabulary of names or persons. The first, he said, is used in every-day 'chit chat,' and and the second in the schools, but the third, he declared, to be of the most importance. Well-read people, he declared, have an acquaintance almost personal with many personages they have never met. Three sources are open, Mr. Masson declared, from which this same vocabulary may be obtained. These are the daily newspaper, the weekly newspaper and the monthly reviews. The first, he asserted, are so hurriedly edited as to be often incorrect; the second, having more time, are usually more accurate, while the third class contains the substance of the news in the best forms.—South Life Magazine. Among the many race enterprises of Memphis we note the following: Thirty-five groceries and meat markets, 6 undertaker ehops, 3 cemeteries, 6 blacksmith and horseshoeing shops, 10 shoemakers, 4 harness and saddle makers, 2 old folks’ homes, 2 Infirmaries, 1 hospital, 2 newspapers and 2 church organs, 50 boarding houses and 12 restaurants, 4 drug stores, 2 banks, 60 barber shops, 40 pressing clubs, 7 printing plants, 1 shoe store, 1 gents' furnishing store, 1 photo studio, a park theater, 4 jewelry shops, 12 coal and wood compsnies, 1 supply house and 1 swimming pool. Memphis has also to her credit 12 lawyers, 30 physicians, 4 editors, 60 preachers, 110 school teachers, 80 carpenters and woodworkers, 120 brickmasons, 80 hodcarriers and mail carriers, 60 dressmakers and hairdressers; colored population, 52,000; real estate owned by them, $3,000,000. This is not in any sense a bad showing —Memphis News. No lady, colored or white, wants to force her way through a crowd of jostling men and boys such as is wont to congregate before negro paces of amusement rr worship. —Charleston (W. Va.) Advocate. A South Carolina negro, Lewis H. Wagner, having raised the amounts of money orders to bring about his imprisonment, wants to be sent to the federal prison in Atlanta, Ga., in order to perfect an invention, so he says, requiring the use of tools to be found in tbat place of incarceration. If this is true, it is indeed stranger than fiction. Jack Johnson was fined $100 in Newcastle, England, November 3 for overspeeding. His disregard for certain laws hasn't been rectified as yet. ",

Fairfax is pastor, was the occasion for a Jarge gathering of prominent citizens, educators and  professional men and women, srho are deeply interested in the work of the  organization. Besides the principal speaker of the evening, Dr. Joshua A. Brockett, Aladam Noble and George R.  Margetson took part in the splendid literary program rendered. The banquet orator was the Rev. J. Andrew Patterson of New York. the noted author. lecturer and psycho-physical culturist. Dr. Patterson has given years of study and research on subjects relating to health conditions among the colored people of the United States. He has also made careful investigations from time to time of the death rate among our people as to cause, age and kind of disease and the sanitary condition of residence, whether  city or country, in which large numbers of colored people live. Dr. Patterson's address was listened to with close attention. He said in part: 'The signing of the emancipation proclamation by the immortal Lincoln was a long stride toward the colored man’s freedom, but the sudden trausition from the forced simple life of slavery into the unknown complex conditions and responsibilities of freedom carried with it a calamity to the race more appalling to contemplate than the passing of the American Indian. The Indian of the border line of civilization needed to adopt but few of the vices and customs of modern civilization to exterminate him. 'On the other hand, the colored man is functioning right in the midst of a thousand rices, customs and conditions that will destroy any young race. And as a sincere student of this staggering question, being armed with irrefutable facts, I warn the colored people of America that unless something is done to stop this maddening dance of death before the twilight of another century falls the nations of the earth will have walled the dirge of another lost race. The real facts concerning the true moral and physical condition of the race relating to the increasing death rate are little understood by ministers and teachers. who bold the destiny of the race, as it were, in their hands. 'Not only is this generation innately inferior physically to the antebellum Negro. but for lack of knowledge the vast majority is not and cannot conserve its energy. In many sections Marriage is sadly waning. Among those who are married aversion to rearing familles is a scourge in itself that is blasting at the very foundation stone of the future race. 'Of every 100 colored children born: fifty die before the second birthday is reached. Is that all? No. Unmentioned thousands pass who never know an independent heart pulse. 'Insanity is rapidly increasing among Negroes under twenty-five, Consump- tion, or modern tuberculosis, ts becom- ing an epidemic almost as prevalent as the conventional bad cold. Already the young people under twenty-five are dying three to one white. 'There are those who will tell you that all is well,that there is no danger of the race dying off. I ask as one having authority, What will the future be? The speaker told of the wonderful work being done by the mind and  body culture movement and the new health culture which principals, if applies, would soon remedy the present condition of the race.

    cardTitle: "Evidence of African Origin Of Egyptians",
    cardSubtitle: "Migration and Colonization of the Chief Causes of Amalgamation of Primitive Races",
    cardDetailedText: "A great many modern writers and not a few who wrote in an earlier period are disposed in discredited the Aftrican  origin of the Egyptians, although their color, customs, and other physical characteristics clearly indicate that if any race of people on earth came out of the loins of Uam these did. Nothing seems to be more ceritain to those who have studied the question closely. Dr. Felis von Luschau professor of anthropology in the University of Berk, wrote an admirable paper before the first universal races congress, which met in London in 1911. approaches the subject with more candor und honesty that usually characterize the writings or the utterances of white men who have investigated this subject. While we know or have been told that all the Egyptians are not white or brown or of any of the intermediate colors between white and black, we also know from those who have traveled in that country that the majority of its Inhabitants are black and possess all the physical characteristics of the African. Cause of Distinct Color Varieties. The color of the Egyptian results therefore. from the admixture of the blood of neighboring races with the African blood of these indigenous blacks. Professor, von Luschau says: While the first varieties of primitive man were certainly formed and fixed by long isolation, later variations and races were caused by migration and colonization. as might perhaps best be showed by sketching the anthropology of Africa and the Pacific islands. Just as Madagascar was peopled about 900 or 1000 A.D. by Indonesian colonists coming from Sumatra, so untold ages ago the first inhabitants of Africa came from a place somewhere In southern Asia on the great line from Gibraltar in Australia. No skulls or skeletons of these earliest Africans are as yet known, but we may hope to find them sooner or later. as we already now know a good many sites of paleolithic implements in various parts of tropical and southern Africa. The anatomical , qualities of these first Africans will certainly be found to differ from those of aboriginal  Australians but in tens of hundreds of thousands of years the paleolithic African evolved into a real negro. He  exists in two varieties- a tall variety like the modern Nigerian from the coast of upper Guinea and a small  one    Third Race Makes Its Appearance But I have already stated that we are as yet quite ignorant of the real home of these small races. To these two oldest element in Africa was added  ages afterward, but still in prehistory times, a third one, the Hamitic It is descended from the same ancient Gibraltar Australia line. but was in a higher stage of civilization. These hamites had already a greatly refined language. With an admirable grammar closely related to that of the Samnite and Indo-Germanic languages In Egypt they created more th:u 6,000 years ago the marvelous civilization we now admire as the mother of our own. Ancient Hamitie influences can be traced all through African. In Abysinia, in Galia, Somali. and in Maasilayd  we find even now Hamitic languages or at least Hanitic grammar and Hamitic types. In central Africa. in the region of the great lakes, we have the Hima and Tusi, generally as chiefs reigning over Hantu tribes, often with face and figure like those of the old pharaohs of Egypt. Physical Features of Hamitic Type Even in South Africa nearly 1 percent of the actual Bantu population have high and narrow noses, thin lips and fine large orthographic skulls of the Hamitie type. and all the Hottentor languages and dialects have a pure Hamnitie grammar. Also the pastoral habits of many Africa tribes. their long horned cattle, spiral basket work. etc. are Hamitie. and all can thus trace hamitie influence from the Nile to the Cape of Good Hope. Still there are some Negroes and many, many white people in this country who profess to believe with a sort  of pitying contempt that the African is an unredeemable barbarian. Rev E B L Thompson of Sierra Leone  West Africa in his address before the Negro Society For Historical Research of Yonkers N. Y. on the  subject 'Race consciousness Race Ideal' said among other things: 'As the preponderance of the: inhabitants of Egypt today are of unmixed African blood, we may I think reasonably conclude that these people are of African origin. Otherwise how are we to account for their black faces, crisp hair and other typical Negro physical characteristics?'",
